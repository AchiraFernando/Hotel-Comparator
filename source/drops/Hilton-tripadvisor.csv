"Chamindar,darell,dulip are outstanding@their hospitality client servicing I feel so good their so efficient@what they do appreciate their excellent client service will highly recommend Hilton stella to everyone cheer keep rocking regards Habeeb"
"Good location, beside World Trade Center, Dutch Hospital entertainment area. This is an old hotel but well maintained. Great food and beverage, especially coffee at lobby lounge and coffee shop...great Flat Whites, and all the food was high quality during my stay.,The hotel staff are excellent, without exception.,Overall, a great hotel and excellent value for money. Room renovations are planned, but although the rooms are showing their age, my room was spotlessly clean and everything worked!!"
"Three days after the deadly explosions in Colombo. The Hilton was the only hotel which had a functioning coffee chop, restaurant for in-house guest. The security was the best I saw among several 5star hotels in Colombo. Staff was courteous and professional, always making my friends and I safer. I had complementary stay at another hotel by the lakeside, I ditched it to stay an extra night at the Hilton. Well done!!!"
"We stayed at the Hilton Colombo March 2019 to celebrate my wife’s birthday, and we really enjoyed the experience. Great facilities were appreciated including the main restaurant. Club Lounge was also excellent - very comfortable with good service and great choice of food and beverages. Certainly one of the better Lounges that we have visited over the years. Please note dress code during the Happy Hour - men to wear long trousers. Live music in the main lobby / bar area every evening kept us entertained. Hotel in a good location with attractions nearby - particularly around the Dutch Hospital area which is very close to the hotel. Colonial buildings with good choice of restaurants and bars. Best of all was the quality of the staff. Particular commendation for Andreana from Guest Relations. Andreana is very good at her job, and gave us exceptional service before, during and after our stay. Thank you Hilton Colombo - we will be back!"
"We recently, last week, had a wonderful day by the swimming pool at Hilton Colombo.  After arriving from a long flight from UK, it was great to relax and chill out by the pool.  Our lifeguard was Krishantha who helped with sun beds and local information. Very polite and helpful, and his English was easy to understand. There are some great restaurants at Hilton and the breakfast in the main restaurant was magnificent. We really enjoyed the food and it set us up for the day. There is a business complex next to the Hilton,  where youI can easily get local SIM cards and reasonably priced data packages."
"Wonderful hospitality, great resturants & bar, excellent staff. Spacious rooms, high tea and evening drinks at the executive club are great. Maintains Hilton standards and comparable to hotels worldwide."
"My misses and I stayed 4 nights and my Dad was here for 1 night,  our stay were awesome from walking into the door, amazing friendly welcome,  everything was so smooth from checking inn till to get a ride or information where to go,  there really went the extra mile,  ,Graze what to say,  we had every day a beautiful fresh breakfast selection from western till local cusine,  cooked to order or special requests you name it, there deliver ..same goes for dinner,  I stayed in few Hilton properties,  but this is one is the best I stayed, I really want to come back. ,Thanks for the amazing time. "
"Stayed at Hilton Colombo for the first time ever though been to Sri Lanka quite often. ,The property is decent and so the room sizes. The staff is quite friendly and the coffee shop next to reception is fairly decent and well priced . The breakfast buffet spread is very good. ,Overall complete experience is value for money"
Spent Easter Sunday 2019 at the Hilton Colombo.  The staff provided excellent service and showed sincere concern for the guest.  Quality of food was excellent.  Property is centrally located and hotel security is excellent.
"We stayed 2 nights at the Hilton and our stay was excellent. The room was very nice, comfortable and the staff are very friendly.  The Buffet at the Restaurant offer a variety of dishes. The room has a nice view where you can see the sea side."
"Superb staff - all amazing and make the place from doormen to bar staff, wonderful.,Executive room - tired and dated floor but fantastic views.,Problems started when we arrived home and checked credit card bill, used an Amex free night voucher which when offered on check out was declined politely by the front office staff member. Found when checking that that an amount of money was taken without authorization. It has taken many days of back and forth to try to get this resolved. It has left a very sour taste of what was a lovely visit."
The place has improved since last time i was there. The redesign is almost perfect. Recommend anyone who wants a place to stay at. Restaurants easily accesible besides the in house meals. Rooms well maintained and all aminitys available. A great variety of food in the buffet
"Visited Sri Lanka from the 8th April to 16th April. Visiting family in Colombo so my stay was only in Colombo. As a a Diamond member I was able to use the executive lounge. I cannot praise the team highly enough. Very attentive staff, manager personally greeted me and I felt very comfortable in the lounge, even though I could have breakfast in the main restaurant I chose to go to the lounge as the service was brilliant. Choice of breakfast and cocktail hour was fantastic. Wonderful lounge and staff.,Reception lobby and bar and gym staff were very friendly and helpful. Every where I turn every one was so helpful.,My room was very clean and I had everything I need. Housekeeping were brilliant too. I cannot find fault anyway. Brilliant staff and lovely hotel.,The staff make the hotel what it is.,Will be back soon hopefully."
"The rooms really need updating, the a/c is hard to keep at a comfortable temperature and the furniture is very old fashioned. Fresh coffee rather than grim Nescafe instant coffee sachets would be nice .,Great selection at breakfast, from European to local options."
"Hotel is in very nice location. Food and breakfast is quite good as usual Hilton. ,There is only one minus point which is the smell from AC system because of humidity. If you are sensitive about this, other Hilton residence is very good alternative !! I tried both. "
"The entire experience was amazing. We were checked in within minutes. I was offered the Diamond benefits and treated as royalty. When the reception team got to know that we were leaving early AM, they had packed sandwiches and brought tea at 5.30 AM. The srilankan fish and sea food dishes during dinner was delicious and would love to experience it again. "
"Rooms are good and comfortable. Wifi works without any problems. Service is prompt and courteous. Breakfast spread was exceptionally good for our group... masala dosa, idli, poha, etc.,Location is quite close to the beach."
The hotel location and the grounds are great. It's really nice place to stay for a holiday as you do get the holiday feels there. Everything was as great as you can expect from Hilton. The location of the hotel is also in a great place. It is a walk from the Dutch Hospital which is a great place to hang around.
"Great location, awesome hotel and incredibly friendly staff.  I will definitely stay at the Hilton Colombo again.  The breakfast buffet has so much variety.  The turn down service in my room was fantastic."
"Me and my family went on holiday  to sri lanka recently and had a chance to pop in to the Italian restaurant in Hilton hotel colombo ,What a night to remember staff...food..atmosphere..even the music was so relaxing ,I will be dinning there again and would recommend any one to go there and try their sea food  pizza...yammmmmi"
"Superb service from all staff, particularly in the Executive Lounge. Gihan and Samuel are great ambassadors for Hilton. Dinesh went out of his way on my last evening to sort out shower and change facilities for me before I left for the airport. I can't thank him enough"
"We enjoyed our stay at the centrally located Hilton, whose staff always make you feel special You just have to walk out of the hotel to the old Dutch hospital for some sensational local food. The views from some of the rooms are also great"
"Sensible, clean , organised hotel with exceptional staff.,The pool and health club are glorious and not to be missed.,Breakfast - outstanding.,The executive lounge was a bit too formal. Needs a female staff member or 2. Food was superb and we'll presented.,During my stay Andreana - guest relations officer, assisted me with some super service. The best I've had at a hotel. She  has great manners, she's articulate and well groomed. She anticipated any requirements I had. Truly Wonderful.,Be sure to put the Hilton colombo on your accomodation list. You won't be disappointed. I'll stay again."
"We stayed 3 nights before heading out on to explore the island. The staff were wonderful - very welcoming and helpful. The lobby is grand and modern. The check-in was quick and efficient. We were happy with the room. The bed was comfy. We phoned the Magic # and asked for extra pillows which were delivered promptly. We are HH members and used the club lounge which has a nice view over the lotus pond with all the swans. The club lounge spread is great. We enjoyed the breakfast, afternoon tea and evening snacks and wine. Everything was tasty. The main buffet restaurant on the main floor has a huge spread and has all kinds of foods. We used the gym. It has many machines. We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Colombo and would recommend it. "
We only stayed here 1 night as our flight got in really late and we were travelling to Kandy in the morning. The rooms were nice  with comfy bed although the bathroom maybe a little dated. The service was great chocolates and fruit on arrival with complimentary water. The breakfast in the morning was amazing. Great variety great quality I would highly recommend it. 
"The Hilton is very centrally located and its smack across the Dutch Hospital.. where you find lots of restaurants and also the fabulous Spa Ceylon,But I really just want to tell you about how fantastic the hotel is. Although it is an old hotel and yes they should be due for some renovations.. but its anwonderful plce to stay because I doubt the size of hotel can be found anywhere!They have a fabulous land area of 6 over acres and staff that were very nice!Our room has a view ofbthe Indian Ocean and that was gorgeous!,The breakfast buffet is outstanding- the sri lankan section was authentically local.. spice level included so not for the faint hearted!,Then there is the Curry Leaf.. an amazing spread every evening in an out door thatched area that serves beautiful cuisine with a few changes made to the menu nightly!,Special salute to Mr Bernard, the Asst Restaurant Manager who told us the history of the hotel, the food and how wonderful their GM is!And of course the sous chef-Mr Amila who has worked for the hotel for 22 years. What pride rhey hold their hotel in.. it is amazing!!The executive lounge staff were also really pleasant!,I loved my stay at the hotel and I will be back soon enough!"
"This is a nice hotel and the staff was extremely helpful and courteous. 5 stars to the concierge who helped us with transport also.  However, the rooms are dated and really need to be re done.  Great location walkable distance to shops and restaurants. ,Breakfast was good too !"
Exceptional customer service.  Delicious breakfast buffet.  Excellent service and good food and beverage selection in the executive lounge. The rooms are not the most modern however they are very comfortable and clean rooms.  
"The Hilton is in an excellent downtown location; You can get around easily with tuktuks or  uber/taxi or even walk to many places downtown. The rooms itself are not very special, but absolutely ok and good. The lobby with bar and outdoor restaurant is very nice, but what really impressed me was the breakfast which was one of the nicest I had in a long time. I'd definitely go again."
"Without a doubt this hotel has the best service in srilanka.. can say this because service by “keminda” at the lab is a example of perfect and excellent hospitality! ,Special thanks to keminda for making our day even better with great service and putting smile to our face :) ,5/5"
"I have been staying here on and off since the mid nineties.,Its a comfort to come back to a familiar setting with an excellent location and great service. ,Lots of changes since I was here last but the all day dining restaurant, just off the lobby has had a major refurb - beautifully kitted out with a wow factor buffet - breakfast is just out of this world.,What I love about this property is the staff know me after a long time. One guy at Concierge walked over to me who I have known 24yrs just walked up and gave me a hug and welcomed me back - Kumar, thank you.,Kapila and Christo the dream team in food & beverage gave me a fantastic welcome.,My only regret is that the Echelon Pub and Gables have disappeared - 2 of my favourite haunts.,If I had any negative comment it would be the bathrooms are tired and need upgrading but saying that - recommended for the complete package especially service."
"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Colombo.  The location is excellent, and the quality of its restaurants is amazing.  From the fish buffet at the Curry Leaf to the great happy hour at the Executive lounge or the breakfast at Graze Kitchen.  Great Hilton property!!,Perhaps my only suggestion is that the hotel really needs to start thinking about renovating the rooms.  There are many new hotel chains set to open in Colombo, so having modern rooms is essential to continue being one of the best hotels in the country!!!"
"I had the best hotel stay I've had in years thanks to the Hilton Colombo. The team of very friendly staff go above and beyond which made my stay so special. A special thanks goes to Kris from the Executive Lounge who is a consumate host.,I stayed in 1624 which is one of the refurbished rooms and I loved it. The view of the harbour was magical and the bed heavenly. Breakfast was the stuff of legend and the gym and pool were top notch. This whole place is Conrad quality at Hilton prices. I loved SL so much I'm already planning my return and when I do, the Hilton is definitely where I'll stay. Try it and you won't be disappointed!"
"Stayed at the Hilton Colombo for 2 nights. Upon arrival, check in was relatively smooth although I felt a little more could have been done here. Receptionist was more inclined to just take my block payment and not cover any of the essential information such as where Breakfast will be, or confirming how long I will be staying for or even escorting us to our rooms. I was just handed the card and told what floor it was. So I would suggest more of a social interaction would help add to a guest’s experience here. However, this is a small point which shouldn’t overshadow what a wonderful hotel this was. The staff in general were fantastic, whether it was the cleaners, staff at the restaurant and doormen, we were always greeted with smile and best wishes. It was great., ,The Food for breakfast was fantastic so please provide our thanks to the chefs and all the staff. We were spoilt for choice in selections. As for the room – the rooms are little dated and the smell of smoke does linger through the corridors but all works well and we had no issues. I had a chance to use the gym there too – it is across the bridge on the other side of the road which is a little difficult to get to however, there is a great set of cardio and weights equipment."
"We stayed for 1 night at Hilton Colombo. The service both at check in and at the Executive Lounge was top notch. The lobby and the lounge seemed recently renovated. The rooms (we stayed on 16th floor) need a refresh. The carpet was pretty old and worn, the bathrooms are quite outdated and the mattress was pretty old. Overall a good experience due to excellent service. "
"A good hotel, but not the 5 star you might expect elsewhere. Good food at breakfast, and the Curry Leaf offers some tasty local food on site. The pool area also offers food and drink, but is a short walk over a bridge, and is next to a railway. Nice enough but not 'tranquil'. The room was comfortable, decent (firm) bed, nice crisp linen but the decor is tired and a tad grubby in places. In my room there was a clod of hair on the carpet that didnt shift for several days. Staff super friendly. Compared to the Shangrila close by this hotel needs to up the ante on presentation but all in all not a bad hotel for the price. Also conveniently situated for the Dutch Hospital."
"The Hilton hotel provides very accommodating staffs who are quick to provide their services. In addition, their spacious interior is calm and cozy that it provides a very private experience. And next by the window seats is a great view of a majestic large fountain. A special mention to two of their staff, Hansi and Keminda who are always at their feet to offer a very welcoming hand."
Just want to write a quick review about the excellent service provided by the staff at Lab. For a drink by yourself or with a friend its one of the classiest places you can find in Colombo. The ambience is amazing and a place you can relax. I highly recommend it.
"It has been truly a wonderful repeated experience at Hilton Colombo continuously for the last 6 days. ,I have been there for may times for various reasons incl business, family, training, etc., and the experience gained is simply excellent ! They have consistently maintained their standards over the years well and getting better and better now with their excellent staff who work as a very cohesive team. ,A special note of appreciation shall go to the L A B Manager, Hansi Lorensuhewa who always shows an exemplary customer care and hospitality to all her guests incl small kids.  ,Excellent food at Graze Kitchen, always !,All the very best Team Hilton Colombo !"
Great stay. Food is great. Service excellence from staff. Rooms lovely and spacious.Views are stunnimg. one might is not enough. Need time to spend in the town. Live entertainment on hptel was good. Enjoyed
"When Hilton first opened their new restaurant we were totally unimpressed. Never went back until yesterday. A friend staying at the Hilton invited us for dinner. We ala carte.,We were pleasantly surprised how much the restaurant has improved. Belonging to the Association of British Residents we received a 15% discount as well. I am suggesting try their food. Brilliant."
"Very nice food range. From indian, chinese, arabic, Japanese, Sri Lankan, italian and many more. Sweet items are very nicely done for the indulgence of the guests. Service is great and the staff is very attentive."
"The hotel is located close to the beach. We were able to catch a Tuk Tuk.  However, the breakfast buffet is the best in the world.  It caters to all cultures and food tastes.  You can’t go wrong with the food!"
"The Hilton Colombo is a great business hotel—meeting space is convenient to guest rooms and very compact making it easy to hold meetings.  The rooms are great and I think they are getting ready for some renovations.  The one negative in the rooms—they have removed the wall hair dryers and replaced with a nice handheld one, just one problem—there is no plug in the bathroom so you have to dry your hair at the desk️.  There is an awesome restaurant by the pool called Il Ponte and it is absolutely wonderful.  You sit by the pool and feel like you are in a resort but are still in downtown Colombo.  Rahman Sariffodeen and Priyantha Senararhne were so wonderful at IL Ponte.  We had a private dinner for 35 people and it was seamless!  Thanks to all.  Randuli DeMel and Anish Subhedar did an outstanding job managing our meeting and Jeewa Nageswaran had to work magic on our reservations and was great.  Thank you all for all your hard work!  Great job!  "
"Uber works perfectly fine and accept credit card payment.,Don't listen to the hilton staff when they tell you that Uber will only work with cash, is their way to make you book their transportation services.,The pick up is around 65usd which is insanely expensive and the taxi service is a little bit cheaper, you can bargain! they will tell you an amount first but if you say you prefer to handle your own because its too much they will lower the price.,Note: Many hotels offer the service free of charge to the airport, as normal."
"I use the Colombo Hilton regularly for business trips and it is the team of people working at the hotel that make your stay a fantastic experience. As a result of Manesh Fernando the GM of the hotel doing such a grand job, I took on a further 3 rooms during my stay and convinced my friends to stay at the Colombo Hilton and they had an unforgettable experience.  "
"Me and my wife arrive srilanka to arrange my visa for another country and hilton was our first choice to stay ,Before arrival I had to change my reservation for an earlier day and I did inform this to hotel reservation and I clearly ask to arrange a hotel car to pick me up from airport and the reservation staff who was a man he did reconfirmed everything from me but guess what it was not been arranged however the staff I met in the airport went way from his job and even my name was not on his list he did arrange a car to me for hotel , from the moment I arrive to the hotel everything was changed , the welcome I got from front desk staffs was amazing .,Until my departure everything was fantastic may be a thank you will not be very much compaire to their service our room boy kasun , one of the waiter Kamindha and the dinning team was way beyond their service to make us happy ,Quality of food , ,Thank you so much ,We will come back to Hilton Colombo ,Mohamed & Hollie "
"Fantastic hotel located a few minutes walk from Colombo Fort railway station.,Check in is warm. and friendly with Samual, a Trainee Front Office staff member. He informs me that my room. has been upgraded to a King Executive Suite. Sweet. ,The room is essentially an oversized studio with 2 bathrooms, living area, and Kind sized-bed. There are some lovely welcome amenities including a bottle of red wine, large fruit basket, and a box of delicious Hilton chocolates.,The Executive Lounge on the second floor, I am told by the Manager, has a different theme each night. Tonight is Chinese. Had I been a day later it would have been Sri Lankan.,The gym and pool are located over a bridgeway across from the hotel. I don't use the pool but the gym is excellent. I also treat myself to a sports oil massage costing only around SGD 30.,I have breakfast the next day at the main restaurant on the lobby floor. The view outside is of a pond filled with Black and white swans, and carp. Beautiful.,Service is exemplary throughout the hotel. The facilities are excellent. It is really an excellent place to stay for a stopover when visiting Colombo."
"Hilton Colombo is very much locationally advantage as you are close to business district with next to world trade centre. rooms are fine, washrooms are clean but the set up is bit old styled. power sockets are just at the work table in the room and no where next to bed; washroom is basic. might be some floors have been renovated but the one we stayed in was not. food is fine and the staff is prompt and courteous."
"Excellent spread. Enough choice, Japanese Corner, sweets, savouries, drinks, deserts Value for money. Always Hilton has its high standard maintained. From the entrance until you leave you get excellent service. Hilton Colombo still maintain high standards and reflects the Good management"
"This was our first trip to Sri Lanka. The hotel and staff exceeded our expectations. Every day we were met with a friendly and accommodating staff. Our every need was attended to and if it could not be done, they would find a solution. Great experience."
We recently attended a wedding here but have also eaten here on numerous occasions in the past in the restaurants. The hotel has fairly recently undergone renovations and is now very pleasant to enter and spend time in. Service is excellent and we have always found the food very good. Service at the recent wedding we attended was very professional and attentive and the whole event was very well overseen by the hotel.
Was a excellent experience and a fantastic foods with crab and prawns also a grate service by the team really enjoyed and most memorable moments in the hotel. The blue welcomes us with a grate welcome drink and snacks. Variety of foods and drinks super super.
"Although the rooms of this hotel are not new, however they are fresh, clean and comfy. The concierge service is outstanding, the restaurants are super with delicious food and highly professional service.  As for the location, it is well centered and walking distance from everything."
"Hotel was a nice hotel, clean, excellent service.  But there were human traffickers trying to pick up friends of mine at this hotel on our last day there.  Hotel manager reported this and took great care with us on this but makes me uncomfortable recommending this hotel.  Human trafficking is scary and to know that they come to upscale hotels is scary."
"I visited Colombo Hilton for high tea with a friend. There was not much of a vegan/ vegetarian choice.,Ms Hansi was very helpful and arranged for me to have a vegetarian choice.,It was definitely a good management act to help the client.I appreciate Ms Hansi’s thoughtfulness.,I will appreciate vegan / vegetarian options are given in platter as an option in future."
"The grace kitchen is a great place for dinner at Colombo Hilton which offers good food with great taste and the spread was fantastic.,I love the surprise birthday cake and the nice greetings by the musical band at the end of the dinner on my daughter’s birthday."
"We had dinner in Royal Thai private dining room.is exelans.the foods tasty.the service was very friendly.we had good time.mr gihan. Sanje and sanjeewa was take care of u s we came back again ,And they also provide a very good service"
"I love this hotel, it’s not the newest but it has class and great staff. I also really like the lobby bar overlooking the swans it’s a great place for a cocktail. The breakfast buffet is so extensive it has too be seen to be believed.,My parents had their 50th anniversary party there in the downstairs ball room which also has an outdoor space which is really nice. 160 people, fantastic food and great responsive staff. Would really like to than the banquet manager who was great.,We stayed there for two nights and was upgraded to a beautiful suite when made the occasion even more special. ,Thank you all from the Wijayatilake family "
"Visited Colombo for business after a space of 12 years and came back to Hilton. The rooms and interior is still exactly the same - old but everything works, spacious and probably the younger crowd may not like it but extremely suitable for me. Service is very good. So happen they asked how my sleep was on the last night and I shared that a morning ceremony which started early at 4 am across the street woke me up early. When i came back to the room later in the day I found that they gave complimentary beer in an ice bucket in the room. Curry leaf restaurant at the hotel is must try for food lovers. The restaurant serves awesome Sri Lankan spread ( buffet style) with various live counters . Graze restaurant serves world cuisine which is quite good. Will return"
"I stayed for total of five days on two different floors. The booking is fir Executive floor hence i was in 17th Floor first time and the service was excellent from the reception to room service. The room was very tired and old , with the furniture from the mid 80's when they opend it.,Food and the spread was good compare with the other Five Star hotels in town which I have stayed frequently.,The 18th Floor was in contrast was very good and though it was old furniture it was fresh and acceptable. ,Business center was very small very tatty old furniture and mostly unmanned, used it twice and have to call reception to log in, MUST IMPROVE,I will recommend any one , however do complain if you think its not good enough , I did not,,Lovely welcoming staff"
"My first trip back since 2013 and the refurbishment of the lobby and 2nd floor executive room was excellent. Many of the same staff are still there, they remembered me from the previous stay (1-1/2 months) made it feel like coming home. very gracious and so courteous. "
"Location of hotel was convenient and room was clean although a tad old. Excellent service. Hotel ground was spacious, had a nice pool area. Good spread of food at breakfast. Bed was cosy but pillows too soft for me. "
"I had visited Hilton hotel last month during my stay on Colombo, overall the room size was convenient, I can't say any thing about housekeeping as the provide supper service, for the restaurant and bar they had very nice service and delicious food I enjoyed it lot "
"Valentine is a day to remember, but this valentine was remembered so special due to the commitment of Mr.Thushara and Mrs.Hansi (Lab area) from hotel Hilton, Colombo, who nicely and lovely arranged our valentine lunch. Thank you for all the nice and romantic arrangements and all the extra miles you went just to make our day so special"
"One of the oldest hotels of Colombo city which truly lives up to Hilton standard's of hospitality and service . Really nice and spacious rooms . The interiors of the rooms are quite old world and might not suit the current mellinial generation ,I loved it though . ,Curry leaf restaurant at the hotel is must try for food lovers.  The restaurant serves awesome Sri Lankan spread ( buffet style) with various live counters .  ,Graze restaurant serves world cuisine which is quite good . Service at the restaurant is quite patchy and needs improvement ,Would definitely love to stay here again "
"Had a amazing experience. Requested for a room change which was accommodated instantly. Amazing food in the restaurant and the breakfast was a really big spread. ,Over all a great stay and nice hotel....."
"I stayed at the HILTON colombo for 3 nights in January 2019. It's quite upto the Hilton brand name.,Lovely lobby, well stocked and designed Executive lounge and very good and cooperative staff.,But the rooms and interiors feel dated. On enquiring, came to know its due for renovation this year.,Overall a lovely stay. Location is also good, overseeing the Sea and yes the Lotus pond is a very  soothing experience. "
"It starts with the moment you check into the hotel, the premium is placed on service and hospitality, one that was consistent throughout my two week stay for business.  The room needs upgraded, as expected, given the age of the hotel; but the overall experience made the stay memorable and personable."
"stayed for 2 nights excellent service by staff Thank you all for making our family feel,Like home. ,Special thanks goes to ,Jeewa , zeinab ,madu, erada, gayan, krishantha,gihan,sachith, and all front office staff. "
"As a regular loyal guest I have checked in with the Hilton Colombo,Sri Lanka. And must say have stayed once in every hotel Sri Lanka has, but Hilton has it evrything be it service food access etc..... it's the best. As a repeater I love the floor 13th and specially #1311. Love you guys keep your best work up the ladders to rule the hospitality you deliver each and every time."
"Cannot fault the hotel, staff were amazing and our waiter Charish was brilliant!,Food was brilliant, breakfast was superb.... Would happily stay here again!,I'd recommend the pool, massage, breakfast and Curry Leaf restaurant!"
Had 4 great days at the Hilton. Staff was amazing and very helpful. Breakfast was a delight and had the best sushi for lunch. Only Complaint were the pillows...could not get comfortable and hard to sleep on
"The day we had checked in to the hotel it's remarkable. We was excited to there warm welcome to the hotel ,it was very professionally. The dinner and the breakfast was brilliant.thank you all staff to your great hospitality"
"I visited on Saturday night Feb 9, just before 10 pm hoping to have some Bar Food or snacks and maybe a Beer. Hung around 15 minutes waiting for someone of the Bar Staff to at least look my way- no luck. Then spoke to someone who seemed to be a Bar manager ,( by the suit he wore). He got me a waiter. Asked for the Bar menu but the waiter gave me only the Wine list and scooted.Maybe being a 'Native' puts one at a disadvantage at the Hilton Colombo.,The food is always pricey- just a small meat pie costs about $9 or 10.Beer cheap and good.Service mediocre. Overall, does not deserve to be called a Hilton.Oh! the Band was far too loud, as always at the Hilton."
"Well done Hilton Colombo, we had a fantastic visit last week. Your team are very attentive and professional. Especially the exec lounge team and the boys at the swimming pool and pool bar. A special shout out goes to the very happy security man at the elevators. Front desk and concierge teams also awesome. Would certainly recommend your hotel to others. "
"Stayed here as usual as I collect Hilton points and have been going to this hotel for over10 years. The lobby area has been renovated and is fantastic - lobby bar, downstairs restaurant etc. the food in the buffet restaurant is amazing and choice is awesome. Employees are always friendly and helpful. The rooms though are aged and very much require a renovation especially the bathrooms. With competition all around the rooms have to be upgraded. Executive lounge is beautiful on floor 2 and depending on the rates worth taking of you are there for a couple,Of days. I will continue to stay there, though with colleagues it is getting difficult due to room quality. "
"The ground-level floors of this hotel were very nice. The rooms were also fine, though dated (I understand they're about to be renovated, so I can't fault them for that). However, one of my travel companions got a knock on the door at 7:45 in the morning (while he was sleeping) asking if they wanted a newspaper, while the others on our group just had a newspaper hung silently on the door. We were all surprised that someone would disturb his sleep so early for something so trivial. Also, on my last night, I received a phone call at 10 PM (again, when I was asleep) stating that I hadn't paid for my room. When I arrived at the hotel two night earlier, I realized that I needed to book an extra night, which the man at the front desk helped me do, though he didn't charge me at the time. The person who phoned me had no record of that interaction and tried to charge me far more than I agreed up on with the concierge two nights previously. We worked it out, but the miscommunication was frustrating. And while I understand them wanting to get their accounts in order, the 10 PM phone conversation could have easily waited until the next morning as I was checking out. "
"we had a gathering in restaurant where the pizza promo runs, that buy one get one free.,same as the better promo, we have witness polite services from the team as well.,food is excellent, great customer care, polite staff"
"Guys let me clarify. I am not racist person but they have special treatment for White then Colors. we were in line to place order in line front guy order things & chef says yes he will do it, When we place an order for Veg Dumpling,chef refused to make it. I called manager and he fix issue. the way chef give me attitude I really don't like it. I strongly believe that color people are getting same attitude like me, then why we going there. Please spread the word so they start treating everyone same."
"We spent 1 night there to end our trip in Sri Lanka and we loved it. Service was really great from check-in to check-out. And food was EXCELLENT! We had a fantastic dinner at the Japanese restaurant in the Dutch hospital, and breakfast + dinner in the buffet restaurant was really amazing (large choice and high quality). I think it is the best buffet we've ever experienced.,Congrats to the team!"
"I like this hotel and stay here often, but despite the communal areas looking fine the rooms really need an upgrade. The furniture is a bit shabby and old fashioned and there are a number of things missing that you might normally expect. They can't seem to get the evening service in the pond-side restaurant right. Twice the vegetables and potato with my superb fish were served cold. Really good band. They don't look great but the make a great sound!,The train will wake you up early, but I have got used to it.,I love the lounge access, great staff and lovely snacks: really nice to return to after a day at the office."
We had an anniversary celebration of our parents at the “GRAZE KITCHEN”. it was such an awesome place to visit and the food was excellent. Crew arranged a cake cutting with the music and it surprised us. Team was very helpful and Dileepa and Nipuni gave us an excellent support. It was a pleasure to be at such a nice place and hope to visit this soon again.

"I arrived very late on my flight and the staff did an excellent job of getting me to my room quickly. The room was very large and spotlessly clean. The bathroom is a bit dated with a bath/shower combo ( such a first world problem!). The bed was comfortable. The property is situated in huge grounds with a huge, beautiful pool area and spa. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. Such great choice, excellent quality and taste. A highlight of this property are the staff, so friendly and helpful.  I look forward to my return visit!"
"I booked an executive room with club access and the entire experience was wonderful. I was sorry to leave after just one night.  The reservation desk was attended by very helpful and charming staff.  The room was very comfortable but the best part was the executive club ... its design, staff and  food were all beyond expectation.  I rate this as the best club I have visited.  Afternoon teas  and evening drinks with delicious food..what a treat.  I needed a very early start and was provided with a boxed breakfast...so large that I couldn’t eat it all!  How thoughtful.  The whole atmosphere was enticing and Christmas decorations were stunning.  I couldn’t have been happier with my stay and wish to acknowledge all the staff who made it so memorable."
"Stayed at Hilton Colombo for 2 nights. Impressed with the Christmas decoration, which is so attractive and nice. Generally hotel room was cozy and comfortable. Most amazing is the service from the hotel staff, very friendly and helpful."
"What I loved about Hilton Colombo Sri Lanka,-The staff at the Hilton Sri Lanka Colombo Hotel is throughout friendly, attentive and makes you really feel welcomed.,-The hotel is conveniently located in walking distance to all major tourist attractions and the Railway Station. The airport is only a 45 minutes drive away.,-The breakfast buffet is really huge, delicious and caters for all tastes.,-The rooms are spacious and have a huge window. Some offer a spectacular views over the Indian Ocean."
"Nice to see the reception area all looking new and modern . Excellent service. The hotel almost seems over staffed but they are all polite & extremely friendly .  Bar service excellent. Breakfast is sensational with a wide range of dishes and a view of the beautiful pond. Wedding in Grand Ballroom was stunning with once again excellent service . The only thing I did not like was the very much dated rooms/bathrooms. They were more than functional but just look tired. However, they are next up for refurbishment so all will be well.  Pool area is good but a bit of a walk over the bridge. Il Ponte restaurant there is divine"
"After initial problems trying to reassure the booking by phone, the management and staff did everything to make the stay a most perfect one. They totally succeeded to deliver. Very impressed with hospitality."
"Excellent staff, convenient location, Hilton Quality Maintained throughout. Executive Lounge managed and run professionally, great selection of food & drinks. Personal touch to all the services rendered."
"The hotel is in great conditions.  I was serviced with the upmost respect.  Room was adequate, clean and well located.  Hotel personnel were friendly and helpful.  Restaurant services a comprehensive buffet option.  Transportation is easily coordinated with hotel and included on your bill.  The hotel is suited for international business travelers.  I'll return again!  "
"I stayed at Hilton Colombo for a couple of nights and absolutely enjoyed the genuine hospitality and professional service of their staff. I particularly value their commitment to training future leaders in the hotel industry through their internship program. Room was spotless and had a nice view of the city and port. Food is excellent--a wonderful experience of Sri-Lankan and international cuisine. And yes, it was extremely affordable given the current exchange rate. Buffet lunch was about USD 10, and buffet dinner was about $15...an ideal place to host business meetings. Make sure to read the info card on safety and security, particularly when walking alone in the neighborhood. In terms of infrastructure, the hotel is one of the older ones in the area; therefore, you may encounter some issues such as plumbing. Don't worry, the hotel staff and management will address every maintenance incident that might arise. I would have given Hilton Colombo a perfect score of 5, if not for one ""imperfection."",Thank you to all of you on staff."
"An unbelievabe experience in many ways.  The hotel was pure luxury with unbelievable dining facilities, bars.  Excellent staff, good location and superb lounge facilities.  The  excellent sports complex and swimming pool were across the road and were accessed via a private bridge."
"The most redeeming attributes of this hotel are the food and the attentive, polite and courteous staff. Smiles and pleasant gestures all the time. ,Buffet meals in the hotel restaurant were phenomenal. Generous variety, tasty and rich food. Every single meal! THANK YOU,Now, as far as the rooms were concerned, much was left to be desired. While the lobby and restaurant show signs of having undergone a recent facelift, the rooms seem to have been forgotten in 1985: fading paint, old furniture and a floor carpet that don’t belong in a Hilton. While water pressure was strong and refreshing, the pale fluorescent lights above the sink made us look tired and weary. The bed and linen were satisfactory. "
"Just unbelievable , im so glad that i chose Hilton  Colombo  . It was just amazing. Specially personally i would like  to thank ruwinda , thushan , shamika and fiona (she is very nice with a lovely smile)   they gave a very  good service. Curry leaf is just amazing . Have noh words to express was so happy and delightful. Will def visit again ."
"We had a superb stay at Hilton Colombo from start to the end.I booked a room to celebrate my husband’s Birthday.They bought a delicious cake to surprise him, free Upgraded with a nice view etc.. Thank you Hilton all the staff members for made our day fabulous. I can highly recommend Hilton Colombo."
"This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. We have stayed at many Hilton’s world wide and we believe this is the best of them.  Great facilities, clean and secure, well located near the seafront and Colombo Fort rail station. Best of all is the staff - terrific at all levels.  If you are having breakfast, the choice is huge. There is a large outdoor pool with plenty of loungers, poolside bar and restaurant. We will certainly return "
"Wonderful Hilton stay, as always.  All the staff were warm, friendly and helpful.  We used the Executive Lounge and the food was very good.  The Lounge Manager came over and welcomed me by name which is a great personal touch.  We were also offered a box breakfast because of an early morning flight which was great.  This location lived up to the Hilton standards, for sure."
"The staff, food, and location are what make this property stand out. The value is outstanding as a Hilton Gold or higher member. Rooms are definitely dated but it's clear the hotel has modernized them as best they can without an entire renovation. They are clean and comfortable. Bed was fine...a little more firm than we typically prefer but not so firm we couldn't sleep. Highly recommend the hotel and the staff are all so friendly and helpful and outstanding. Definitely try the breakfast or get a rate with it included as it's outstanding in variety and quality."
