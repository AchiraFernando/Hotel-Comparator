"It was my brother in law's wedding. Came in early morning. ,Parking- has enough parking place including basement. ,They had arranged the breakfast at South lawn. Calm place but Disturbed by many crows. ,Hall is nice. Having some colonial view. ,Dancing area may need some repair.,Food- selected menu have some battered sea food dish. ,Deserts are very good including chocolate fudge brownie.,Toilets- clean and good."
"First hotel on our visit of Sri Lanka. We arrived at 1:30am, check-in was smooth and we were given a nice room. ,However the next day we opened the terrace door to a wall rather than an ocean view we were expecting. A quick word to the front desk and we paid to upgrade to a much better room with a great sea view,The staff were nice and the hotel facilities are good considering the hotel is one of the oldest in Colombo,The best part of the hotel is definitely the Cuban bar ‘King of the Mambo’ "
"Stayed in Galle Face 2 weeks before the terror attack in Colombo ( Saddened so much to hear after having such a wonderful time)...It is absolute rude shock. Coming to the hotel, probably one of the best hotel with old British style. One has to stay and experience if you are a lover lovely wooden furniture still you feel in 5 star hotel. It has got one of the beautiful private beach...with elevated view. Food is awesome. You get best of the decent yet attractive night clubs. Enjoyed swimming pool just above sea level...you feel you are in a beach yet in swimming pool. Worth the every penny you spend. It is also a good family destination."
"We stayed there for a few days before the dreadful attacks. What a shame, the impact will undoubtedly affect this place.,Very friendly staff; delightful place and utterly relaxing. Good breakfast as well and nice bars/restaurants.,Definitely recommended."
"Beautifull colonial hotel on the beach, full of historical moments of Colombo, bar and dining are amazing and just to have a breakfast in the terrasse is already a unique experience, I travel all around the world and my stay in Gale Face was fantastic. Congrats."
Final night of a tour was the highlight. Could not have asked for better service including a late checkout and being looked after right up until the car picked us up. The flag ceremony at the going down of the sun was especially poignant and very British. Cocktails on the lawn were relaxing.
"The wooden architecture is really beautiful and the staff is really friendly. ,Good location and closer to the beach and other local shopping areas. ,These days since the terror attacks the security is a bit high but no complains because those things are really essential for security purpose."
"The rooms are exquisite with two cleankngcservices per day.The location is on the bay and by sleep with the sound of crashing waves in your ears. Staff and food are amazing. A must visit hotel for personal care . You are family, not a guest "
"The best place to stay hands down in Colombo. ,From the moment we arrived the service and friendliness of this lovely historic hotel was amazing.,We were there with a very large conference some 300 people. Nothing was too much trouble.,Do yourself a favour and go to Sri Lanka and stay at Galle Face.,It is not to be missed."
Went to Galle Face hotel to grab a quick bite and some drinks with family. Look for Malinda @ king of mambo. Great service had a pleasant time dining on a fine day out facing the ocean at open terrace
I am extremely disappointed with the management of the hotel. We meant to check in on Easter Sunday 21/4/19. As you all know Sri Lanka was shaken by a string of terrorist attacks that morning. We were advised not to move hotels and stay in put. The taxi service wasn’t working in the hotel we were staying in as a result of the attacks as they said it was not safe to go out. We have called the hotel and asked if they could send us a taxi to transport us to the hotel (which obviously we would pay for) they told us they can’t as their transportation service isn’t running as well due to the terrorist attacks. I told them if that’s the case there is no way that we can check in. However after 3 days they took the payment from my card. I have contacted Booking.com as I have booked through them and being on the phone for over 50mins the lady told me the hotel is refusing to refund the money as they marked us as ‘no show’. I found it disgusting that they are still trying to make money out of the unfortunate situation. It’s very sad.
"We love this place the staff are amazing it is very well priced for a fabulous grand hotel and I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a great Sea view,We have been here during this time of the ,Bombing but the security is incredible and ,The staff here have been very diligent and make us feel very safe"
"We stayed for two nights here and were blown away with the facilities, the beautiful old building, the food and drinks and also the staff. Arguably the best hotel I have ever stayed in. A special mention to Lalith at the Long Bar who was especially accomodating every evening - many thanks to him. ,We will be back. ,Thanks, ,Oscar "
"This is an amazing hotel and definitely worth staying at. The highlight is Happy Hour in the Long Room, where the best barman in Sri Lanka, LALITH, will serve you yummy canapés and re-fill your drink as the sun sets and the waves roll in. Thank you LALITH - we look forward to seeing you again next year."
"We were staying elsewhere but visited for lunch. The prices were very reasonable and the food was very good. It was great for kids who are used to western food as there was a good range for them. The view and setting was lovely, making us wish we were staying there!"
Two friends and I recently stayed at the Galle Face Hotel for three nights. The hotel and its grounds are lovely and historic. The pool is particularly nice and relaxing with views of the ocean. I would spend the money to get ocean view rooms above the basic room - they are far roomier and nicer bathrooms. The attacks in Colombo occurred during our stay in Sri Lanka but we felt very safe at the Galle Face and they were very helpful in helping us to navigate increased security at the hotel and the airport. 
"Beautiful, colonial hotel by the ocean front. Lovely big, salt water pool overlooking the ocean (no ocean swimming allowed). Beach front local markets are a one minute walk from the hotel and a tuk tuk into central Colombo is not more than 5 or 10 minutes (depending where you are going; recommend using Uber as it can be used to book tuk tuks). Amazing breakfast selection. Wonderful staff. "
"The minute you step foot into The Galle Face Hotel you know you are in for a special time. I found this hotel to be exquisite in every respect. Our balcony room was spacious , well equipped and with lovely decor. Breakfast was located in an open verandah  overlooking gardens and ocean and offered a large range of SriLankan and Western foods. The lounge area offered wonderful afternoon canapés and drinks which was an added bonus with our room selection. The colonial history of this hotel has been maintained and is reflected in the decor and some of the hotels current services. All of this plus a great location made for the perfect beginning to a wonderful Sri Lankan holiday."
"Great hotel. 150 years old and expect that some things are old! Great pool. Several bars and places to eat. Amazing balcony and poolside drinks and food. Piles of history and antiques and interest. Rooms were old but spacious and very comfortable and the service is exemplary. It is a great location too for most touristy sites and a walk in the evening along the sea. Thank you! I hope you are all safe and send huge sorry for the terrible things that happened this week.,Highly recommended."
"It's rare to be at a ""city"" hotel with a pool overlooking the ocean and a bar on the beach where you can enjoy the sunset, yet be able to walk to most attractions of interest.  And the next-door Galle Green is a popular public park where it is fun to stroll at sunset with local families.  Top that off with a 150 year old history, it's own museum, a brand-new renovation and beautiful spa, and you have one of my favourite hotels of a 4 week trip.  Service and breakfast were great and it has fun quirky touches (the slingshot guy who chases away crows, the guy who shimmies up the palm trees to trim them; the bagpiper at sunset).  Recommend the higher priced rooms with balcony and view which come with access to the Long Bar and free Happy Hour drinks and snacks.  Only downside arriving jet-lagged was that the bathroom space is not separate from the bed so if one partner is sleepless, the other will be disturbed."
"This hotel is wonderfully located alongside the sea.  There is a lot going on in the evening with the bars taking advantage of this position.  Very helpful staff, especially in getting our bags back from Qatar Airways.  The food was a bit average, especially the breakfast with juice made from cordial.  Our room was okay bur nothing more than that.  We were greatly impressed with the free mini bar even if it was modestly stocked.  TV reception very poor."
"I first heard about this hotel on an episode of the Amateur Traveller podcast, and had always wanted to visit. And my stay there did not disappoint. Well run, with great service. The hotel and restaurants are very atmospheric given the heritage status from its colonial history. Had a nice view of the courtyard and ocean, with the sound of the ocean surf to put me to sleep. Enjoyed the sundown and flag lowering ceremony complete with bagpipes. Definitely recommended."
"It was one of the most memorable hotel experiences of my life. Quite apart from the obvious beauty of the hotel architecture, the service was impeccable. Amazing staff - from the front desk to the door, the restaurants/pool/long bar, the chamber staff. I can’t fault it and will definitely return. Special mention to Emmanuel, Chief Concierge, who went above and beyond."
Stayed one night in this hotel for our arrival into Sri Lanka for our honeymoon. Lovely hotel with all the old world charm of colonial era. Room was well maintained and had all the trimmings you'd expect of a hotel of this standard. Hotel has quite a bit of history and has many photos of previous hotel stayers like movie stars and bigname political leaders from around the world. They were very thoughtful and making us a welcoming honeymoon cake which was delicious and much appreciated. Staff and service were fantastic and the breakfast was pretty good. Highly recommend this place and would have no problem coming back here.
"A fantastic hotel, full of old world colonial charm. In a great location on the beach & beside the green, close to the city centre but without the traffic.,I loved the way the old floor boards had been retained, some loose, some wobbly.,Room was excellent with a comfy bed and spotless bathroom.,The staff are what makes this hotel special, nothing is a problem and you will always be welcomed with a smile.,The breakfast buffet is everything you can desire and served outside in a covered terrace.,Why would you want to stay anywhere else in Colombo"
"Very special place to stay. Service is done with a smile by all staff and the food is amazing. Beautiful setting right on the water and easy walk close by to the old parliament. The decor and complete layout of the whole complex is a an old style opulent hotel. Also the collection of photographs of who has stayed there over the years is a who's who of stars, presidents, royals etc and the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Phillips first motorcar display is a great touch on the second floor."
"We stayed here for one night. On the plus side.... breakfast was very good, dinner at in-house Mexican was lovely. In general the communal areas were very nice and what you would expect from a hotel like this. ,I was initially not happy with the cost of the hotel car to airport but when arrived it was a large Merc and very very comfortable. Worth additional money. ,The sticking point for us was the rooms that we were allocated, which were in the non-renovated part of the hotel. Avoid if possible. We had an adjoining room requirement and it was one night so no dramas... but they need to sort these out. Mildly depressing and unlike the previous places we stayed in Sri Lanka, we were not too keen on hanging around in the room much. This notches rating from 5 to 4 for us. "
My husband and I had a wonderful time at The Pool Bar at Galle Face. Amazing staff for their excellent service. We visited Sri Lanka for our Sweet holiday vacation. Since Galle Face Hotel is one of the Iconic Landmark we decided to take a look and gladly our time was not wasted. We had a wonderful day at The Pool Bar. Surely once we visit again Sri Lanka were going to stay at this Hotel and be back again at The Pool Bar. Thanks to Mr. Indika and his colleague for making our vacation memorable and wonderful. Keep up a good work!!!
"The location of this Hotel is unimaginable, the boundary wall of which is infinite Indian Ocean. It is on the immediate edge of the ocean. Wonderful view. Restaurant is also just before the edge of the ocean, providing excellent experience. Food and service is also par excellence. Rooms are spacious. It has everything that is needed by any traveler. Only one suggestion. Before using the bathrooms and locking the same, learn from staff how to lock and unlock. Turn the lock only once till you hear click. For opening the lock of the bathroom turn the lock in reverse direction only once till you hear the click. More turns and you may get stuck.@Management: please change the bathroom locks."
Everything here is first class. The staff are very attentive and helpful from advice to breakfast to the pool area. Loved the guy sling shotting the crows. He never hit one but did a great job very entertaining. The room Was quiet except for the ocean waves which was very calming. The restaurants and bars are all around the hotel from fine dining to afternoon snacks. No need to leave the hotel really. The pool area is literally on the beach and spectacular but a bit salty and warm. Great surrounds there for relaxing the entire day on the lounges.  Very recommended. 
"A nice place to experience old world charm. The hotel is old but does not show signs of ageing at all. In fact, the hotel is so old that it has a museum inside the hotel and they have a guided tour of the hotel itself on particular dates/times.,Be sure to read about the hotel before you land there as it will help you explore the hotel. They have a great library and interesting artefacts throughout the hotel.,The swimming pool was a new experience for me with salt water but I did not enjoy it too much.,They have a decent spread for breakfast and a great service though I would recommend this for a lazy quiet trip with your partner rather than with the family.,All in all, it is a nice experience and something that you should do."
"Great hotel, service and location. Happily stay there again. Good food reasonably priced with lots of options. Front of house well run and a range of options with sea views for pre dinner drink,Good sized and clean bedroom  "
"The halls move and creak ever so slightly in this lovely, massive old dear of a hotel.  Renovated beautifully, this place will transport you back a century to a different world, while keeping its hospitality clearly in today.  Like her sister the Del Coronado across the world, Galle Face is, miraculously, dressed and ready for the ball.  You'll find great food and even a designated man with a slingshot to keep away the wise murder of crows that owns the veranda.  We wish we had a bit more time than a day here, as it seems there is much to discover."
"Service can improve, lacks professionalism compared to hotels of this calibre in Asia and also Europe. Food is good, especially the restaurant by the beach which is of South American influence. Taxi service too expensive compared to other hotels."
"The Galle Face is spectacular.  You feel like you have stepped back to another century, and can image the British from the days of the Raj strolling through the hotel. We stayed 3 nights and were sorry we couldn't stay longer.  Our junior suite was lovely, out balcony gorgeous (more lovely than the balcony in The Long Room [the Club Room]).  Buffet breakfast on the terrace facing the ocean was lovely, the food delicious.  Spectacular."
"Galle Face hotel takes you back to a time when service was paramount.,This has not changed and all the staff especially our room staff were very happy to help at all times,Food was superb but as always a little on the expensive side which we have come to expect when we travel.,Would recommend to any travellers looking for a stay in Colombo but it is not really suitable for young kids as does not have much to offer them.,Salt water pool was good but deep all over and if you are under 5ft 6inch you won't touch the floor"
"We stayed here late in January 2019. We love the grand old hotels and this one was excellent. We had a Landmark Qeen Room which was very large and comfortable with a view of the pool and ocean.  The breakfast, which was included, was very good with great variety available.  We left after breakfast.  The front desk arranged for our car and driver to take us to Marissa which worked well."
Beautiful hotel with a sea water swimming pool.  Very attentive staff in the bar areas but a lot of the time the door staff were more ornament than use.  We were upgraded to a sea view for which we were grateful.  Did not eat dinner here but breakfast was delicous.
"We visited for afternoon tea as part of our tour, beautiful colonial style hotel, excellent afternoon tea with fizz. We thoroughly reccomend it as part of your visit to Colombo, very retro and reminiscent of times past."
"May this will be the best ever hotel to stay with your loved one - overlooking the Indian Ocean.,The rooms on the top floor with windows towards ocean is the best. The staff are very well trained and don’t miss the museum"
"The hotel is in good condition,so much to see just walking around it. Some rooms are older style which might not suit everyone.I loved the breakfast area and the food quality was great .Need more shade/umbrellas for the pool.Lovely pool area overlooking the ocean"
"My husband and I  booked the Galle Face Hotel on Booking.com for my first night in Sri Lanka on 17 March 2019.  We arrived with proof of booking and payment of £133 GBP.  I had just arrived after an over night flight from the UK.  Unfortunately, despite this, the hotel could find no record of this and after spending more than 2 hours at reception, did not provide us with the room we booked.  Exhausted, we were left with no option but to leave with nowhere to stay having just arrived in the country.  Losing the money was nothing compared to being treated in this disgraceful way by a hotel of this calibre.  This coupled with the fact that when we used to live in Sri Lanka  we used to go to the hotel regularly and were in fact join members of the swimming pool between 2013 and 2014.  Nobody followed this up with us during our 3 week break in Sri Lanka."
"I stayed on a recent business trip to Sri Lanka. The staff are welcoming, friendly and very helpful. Although an hour or more from the airport depending on traffic, it is worth the effort. If you like the sound of the ocean, make sure you get a room with a sea view. The grounds are simply beautiful and try and make it there for sunset as the Sri Lankan flag is lowered to bagpipe music. Enough to say that I will be back and for more than two night next time. "
The hotel is amazing with lots of history. Very clean rooms and great staff. The breakfast buffet was amazing and so is the pool. The gym is decent could use some more equipment but overall an awesome old colonial hotel!
"You can stay in a marble palace if you prefer - there’s plenty to choose from nearby in Colombo. Problem is, if you let your mind wander, you could easily forget which city you’re in. Galle Face Hotel is different. Stay here and you’re in somewhere unique to Colombo. Not just a fine building oozing history and colonial charm but a very comfortable and superbly managed hotel made special by one magic ingredient that money alone cannot buy. The staff. It’s they who make the place what it is. Every one of them made out visit special but mention must be made of the fantastic reception team, buffet and pool bar staff (thanks to Ashley for his advice and help in planning our trip to Kandy), the laundry service (5*+), and lastly the catapult men for keeping the crows in check. Ignore any negative comments. This place is too good for words."
"We stayed at The Galle Face hotel as a treat on the first 2 nights of our honeymoon in Sri Lanka.,The building is really beautiful and oozes old school colonial charm.,We particularly enjoyed sitting outside having cocktails on the chequerboard terrace and watching the sunset. ,The breakfast buffet was beyond amazing with an array of fruit, pastries, curries, pancake station, omelette station, eggs, sausages, hoppers...it was the highlight of our stay!,We also had an evening meal (Sri Lankan Street food buffet - there's a different themed buffet every night) in the Verandah restaurant which was delicious and again offered a vast amount of choice.,We enjoyed the pool which is very large with an ocean view.,The hotel is extremely well staffed so there's always someone on hand if you need them and all the staff we spoke to were friendly and helpful.,The room was very comfortable but actually quite simply furnished compared to the grandeur of the rest of the hotel.,Small tip - hotel taxis can be expensive, consider using Uber or a metered tuk tuk."
By the Indian ocean this is a gem of old English charm & tradition. The bar is great decorated with the photos of the famous who have travelled there before. The rooms could do with an update but it is still a great place to stay and a nice respite from the bustling city of Colombo. 
We stayed for a couple of nights here and loved it. It has so much charm and character compared to the newer hotel chains. The building is beautiful and the location is surely the best in colombo.  The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was amazing with so much choice.  Would love to go back someday.
"Great hotel very friendly saff, breakfast excellent. Stayed only one night after long flight but very welcoming hotel and staff,Little more old worldly than some of the high rise hotels that are being built now,Right on The foreshore"
A nice few days to relax and treat ourselves between travelling to the more remote parts of Sri Lanka. A beautiful traditional Sri Lankan colonial hotel with lots of history. Good service as you would expect and the buffet dinner was plentiful and tasty .
"Having spent some 12 hours flying from Australia we didn't arrive at this hotel until about 1am. Staff greeted us with a warm towel and refreshing drink that was appreciated after a long days travel. ,The hotel is located on the foreshore of the Indian Ocean near the older former British established section of Colombo. The rooms were a good size, well appointed though like many hotels in Sri Lanka they have firm mattresses. ,Breakfast on the ground floor enabled us to not only enjoy a beautiful buffet food selection that included a hopper and egg station, also a lovely view across lawns to the ocean. Walking around both inside and outside enabled you to appreciate the grandeur of this British origins hotel.,A hotel very worthy of a longer stay."
"Classy service in well maintained facilities. Very different from four or five star chain hotels. History is present at any moment.,Rooms differ from each other  - not surprising bearing in mind the number of renovations this hotel must have gone through."
"We went as a family of four to the Galle Face Hotel in May. We had loads of fun. The pool was warm and sunny, and the buffet was extremely outstanding. But unfortunately, the wonderful view of the big blue Andaman sea is getting smaller as a huge complex is being built on a man-made peninsula. So, go there soon, before it is finished and the view is gone. A wonderful hotel with an enchanting vibe from the 1950s and cute, little rooms. We hope to come back one day. An amazing experience."
This hotel has it's own legend and a history. but it has all modern items to compete with all other hotels around the globe. my tour company highly recommended the hotel. They were right. I won't forget two things. breakfast with the breeze next to the beach and chilling out with cold beers watching sunset. really comfy rooms and food.
"Stayed two nights and would have been very happy to have spent longer at this very good hotel. We loved the old colonial style, the location right on the ocean front, the attractive pool area and the excellent breakfast. Ok the view from our ‘sea view’ room was mostly towards the main road but the room was lovely. We could have done with a bit more information in our room about the facilities such as restaurants (with menus would be helpful) as the building is big and we only came across the upstairs bar and restaurant when we took a wrong turning on the second floor - they both seemed deserted so maybe we weren’t the only ones to be unaware of them. There were complimentary canapés and a happy hour somewhere we were told at check-in but we didn’t come accross this and again there was no information in the room. We could have asked of course but 5.30 was rather early in the evening for us. Dinner time here is early-ish too with many sitting down in the main dining room at 7.00 - we ate later in the bar with live music and the food was ok. Overall we would recommend the hotel and stay there again - next time we might make a bit more effort to work out where al the facilities are located."
"Absolutely fantastic spot to sit and watch the sundown with a chilled out drink.,Be sure to be there just before sundown to catch the bagpipe procession to lower the Flag,If you want to eat, be sure to make a reservation several days ahead; the tables are ALWAYS reserved during high seasons,Great colonial vibe and very chilled.,Staff is friendly and quick but not overbearing,Enjoy!"
"We had 2+ weeks in Sri Lanka staying in both large and very small hotels.  We heard that the Sri Lankan government has introduced environmental policies encouraging refillable supplies, stainless steel straws &/or paper straws etc?  Galle Face are now using paper straws but not refillable containers in bathrooms yet.  Considering that they were one of the most expensive hotels on our holiday, we feel that they need to address this like other hotels have done.  In saying that, our country, Australia, could do a whole lot better as well but we didn’t vote them in!  Other than that, an interesting and relaxing stay...the weather was hot (not too wet yet in mid March) and the pool plus bar was particularly lovely.  Breakfast was very good...loved the freshly made hoppers (see photo).  The history of the place is great - take a read of various information panels plus have a look in their little ‘museum’ if you’re a history nerd like me!"
"Stayed  2 nights in November 2018. First room offered had someone else's balcony outside our window so we're moved to a corner room. Lovely wooden floors and old furniture, large room and lots of shared areas in hotel. Could hear upstairs neighbours as floors all wood. Pool and gardens lovely. Some lounges seemed to be only for club guests but weren't labelled as such, so just sat there anyway and staff seekers bit uncomfortable but did nothing!"
"This colonial style hotel was recently renovated, but has kept every bit of its colonial Charme. It’s beautifully decorated and equipped and the staff is really nice. It’s a beautiful place to arrive in the country and relax. We already came back once and will come back again!"
A really top notch place to come hang out for brilliant guys serving you high grade booze and food.  Pure atmosphere.  A very classy experience  A super special spot that mustn't be missed if you visit Colombo.
"Great Colonial historical hotel, (so dont expect shinny glittery halls & rooms) we had an ocean view room with a terrace so didn't use the pool/bar area...we stayed 2 nights after our arrival in Colombo & after a day touring the city...perfect ...we really didn't fancy any of the big flash named hotels as they are all the same world wide as we wanted a taste of old sri lanka...2 nights is enough.,very friendly staff & excellent service...,Great buffet b’fast & evening buffet, we ate out in the city on the other night."
"Great location lots of history but those place is expensive! I loved the cocktail hour on the second floor. The was only for those staying in a suite so a lot fewer people to contend with, local munchies and decent red wine made it worth the money. But how many times are you in Galle? may as well enjoy a great hotel."
"This hotel is not cheap but it's worth every cent to stay here.  The hotel itself is a little tired but oozes character.  There is a great swimming pool area, the service is brilliant, and the location we loved.  We stayed in a junior suite (2020 which seemed bigger than the others) which gives you access to the club all day for coffee/tea and then aperitf at 5.30.  This is not to be missed.  The breakfast was included and was excellent."
"Good first impresions always count for a happy stay at any hotel,and Nadeesha at reception at the Galle Face Hotel was extremely helpful in helping us with complex flight arrangements back to London via Chennai as well as assisting with a late check out on the 11th.Both her and her colleague were supportive with that wonderful kind Singalese manner."
"We arrived at the the Galle Face after a 12 hour flight from LHR and were greeted by charming staff and a lovely cool towel and lime drink.,The rooms was perfect, we went down to the lawn area for a beer just in time to watch the flag lowering at sunset accompanied by a bagpiper.,We had a dinner in the hotel and enjoyed a wonderful curry and rice with lots of choice .,Breakfast was also excellent , we then departed for our trip round Sri Lanka and returned for our last night .Very nice oceanfront room another excellent breakfast.,O very good venue to start and finish our holiday ."
Alas couldn’t afford to stay.  But went numerous times whilst in Colombo.  For coffee on the breathtaking verandah.  For the amazing buffet breakfast. And for their Vivien Leigh cocktail.  Service is superb. Staff too.  The bar has photographs of who has stayed there. A British Literary who’s who.  And also the divine Viv.  It’s charm and beauty are addictive. The skill and friendliness of the staff second to none.  A trip back in time indeed. A wonderful gentle experience. 
I stayed at the Galle Face for the Ironman 70.3 Sri Lanka. It was superb. The room was beautiful restored but with all the modern appliances  and bathroom. I fell asleep to the sound of the sea. Amazing. They were very polite and put up with me reeling through the hotel with my bike and covered in sweat. Loved the place especially the salt water swimming pool
We spent 1 night at this lovely hotel. The colonial style was very appealing and the room was comfortable .We ate at the restaurant and had a few drinks at the travellers bar . Location was good too with the beach close by and getting out and about to the different areas . Will definitely stay here again on our next trip.
This was a great spa experience ! The L'occitane spa was absolutely amazing - we got a couples spa done. The spa was relaxing and the therapists were very nice. The hotel has a beautiful view and had a very nice grand old feel.
This hotel was one of the memorable parts of our trips. Stunning sea view and amazing food in stylish surroundings. We absolutely loved our stay and would highly recommend. The hotel was so elegant and friendly staff. We got upgraded on check in which was so nice.
"Grand, historic hotel completely refurbished. Reception team excellent. We booked direct and had a Premier Ocean View Balcony Room 3079 (excellent); and we enjoyed the Terrace and Travellers' Restaurants for lunch and dinner over 3 nights. All staff most courteous (including Keeth, our room manager). Swimming pool, sun loungers, pool bar and Galle Green for promenading. A very enjoyable stay!"
"We had an upgraded room with balcony and sea view. lovely big bathroom, all very clean.,Very nice but huge hotel, all very colonial and lovely.,Good restaurant, also a poolside restaurant and a cocktail bar.,Only stayed one night but very good. Good room service."
"Old world charmer, built in 1864. Reeks of luxury, the minute you walk onto the huge marble floored foyer. Our room was comfortable, with a partial view of the enormous courtyard.  The lighting in the room we had was very poor. Bed comfort was good.  ,The buffet dinner had a large selection of various foods, something for everyone and looked out to the courtyard, where you could hear the sounds of the ocean. Unfortunately our time to enjoy the facilities was limited and if ever we return to Columbo we would certainly come back here"
"This hotel oozes history and the location can’t be beat. I would recommend booking directly to avoid booking issues. The Premium Rooms with balcony are worth the extra money! Thanks to Keeth, our housekeeper, for an exceptional job!"
"This was the first hotel on our tour of Sri Lanka and it created a good first impression.,There is history here in this elegant building. Great atmosphere in an excellent setting by the sea.,Breakfast was served on the terrace overlooking the water. After breakfast we walked down to the water's edge to admire the view.,One surprise was to find a uniformed security guard with a slingshot who was keeping the crows and squirrels away from the patrons. I've never seen this before and probably never will see it again.,It's a pity that the lighting in the rooms wasn't better. Then again a lot of hotels all over the world seem to do this. Maybe it's mood lighting but I like to be able to see what I'm doing."
"Stayed two nights at the start of our Sri Lanka trip. We were met by our driver Neil who would drive us throughout our holiday( this is the norm here and very affordable). We arrived in the early hours ,exhausted and wanting immediate sleep. We were given an early check in but had to pay extra. ,The hotel I believe is one of the oldest in the world. It has a charm that only history can deliver. However the rooms are dark ,and very basic but not at a basic price. ,The pool is a big let down. A rectangular box surrounded by beds, no natural shade and insufficient parasols. Many of the parasols are broken. The toilets dingy and ‘feel ‘ unclean. The whole area looks very sad and tired. ,Would I stay again,not unless it has a complete refurb. I would highly recommend cocktails / coffee on the veranda. "
"We always stay at Galle Face Hotel Colombo. Love the old colonial charm. You can feel the history of yesteryears in every corner of the grand old building. ,Excellent meals, no matter what time it is. And, great coffee too, one of the few places we managed to get a real coffee.  ,Take a stroll along the Galle Face Promenade, just the way the Brits been doing for the past 200-300 years. And, enjoy the stunning sunsets."
"We stayed in the Royal Thai Suite during our stay and it was brilliant. ,The lounge area is spacious with a water room.,The bedroom itself is also ample with french doors to the balcony.,The restaurant offers a quality buffet.,The salt water pool is pleasant."
"Grand old hotel with all the old world charm of colonial yesteryear.  Get a feel of what it was like back in the 1800's. The timber features and furniture and decor are glorious and our room facilities were all very modern and we felt spoilt.  The front staff excellent.  The cleaning staff were wonderful. The wait staff were generally all very smiling and helpful.  It was quite amusing to watch the bird scarer at breakfast.  He had a slingshot to hold up to scare the crows off the furniture.  Someone was being employed I guess and it kept the outdoor furniture clean.,The hotel faces the ocean but swimming is discouraged, but there is a pool for those inclined.,Our only negative which was remedied immediately the next morning was that the room we had the first night faced the main street, and it was very noisy at 5 am from traffic. We arrived 2.30 that morning so a sleep in would have been nice. But she changed our room immediately. So that aside we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,Breakfast was exceptional - it seemed a little over the top to me, but you could literally eat the world if you wanted.  But that said, I thoroughly enjoyed my fresh cooked omelettes, the local curries and accompaniments, and the fresh local fruits for breakfast.  "
"We had the most wonderful stay at this hotel, unfortunately it was for one night only but we thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Upon check in we were delighted we had been upgraded. Our room was beautiful - large, airy and had a separate lounge area. We had not one but two plasma screens! Breakfast included a large array of buffet items so to keep everyone satisfied. The breakfast view were dreamy! The only negative we experienced is that there was a very noisy wedding reception which was causing our walls to vibrate, thankfully the music stopped by 11/11:30 pm!"
"My husband and I stayed at the GFH for one night; our first night in Sri Lanka before heading to Tangalle. We arrived just at the right time to watch the sunset from our bedroom, stunning. Although the bed was only a double (used to a bigger bed) the bed sheets were amazing! ,One stand out person for us was the concierge, Emmanuelle. Even though he was due to go off duty, he helped us to secure the train tickets we needed for our 7am journey the following morning. Above and beyond, thank you so much. ,We definitely wished we could have stayed longer than one night and would definitely come back. "
"If you like old grand hotels, this is one of them. The pool is salt water and large enough. Very pretty common areas and large reception rooms where weddings and banquets are held. As an overnight guest, however, the rooms were small and older (updated with limitations) and the sound comes through as ours had a connecting door (one door only) and our neighbor was conducting business loudly on the phone right next to the door.  They had an early morning wake up call and we can hear the alarm. We were told we were upgraded to a room with a sea view but that did not make up for the noise factor. The bed was a double and we are used to a king size. Pool sleep quality.,The breakfast and dinner were buffet style and was fine. birds can snatch your food but they have someone with a slingshot guarding.,Did have a massage at the spa. The therapist was nice and good. The facility is also an attempt at a spa using existing space so it was all a bit odd. The whirlpool was cold and nowhere to sit in the changing room.  We would not return."
"The GFH is one of the oldest hotels in Colombo, and catered to the Colonial types ( ""'no natives please""), who patronized it in days gone by .Unfortunately it still retains the decrepit waiters who have long past their ""used by "" dates. I and a friend visited the GFH (albeit more than a year ago - but the memory lingers) - where we waited 30 minutes before anyone would condescend to take our order."
"Excellent all round. Given its history it could have been stuffy and formal, but it managed to avoid this, and was very relaxed and informal. Service was generally good and only let down by slow service in the bars. The food was excellent in the buffet, and we also enjoyed the King of the Mambo restaurant. Rooms are very nice, and the sea water pool a bonus. Prices for drinks and food were very reasonable considering the surroundings"
"This is a magnificent old building in a fabulous location. while you can see a few signs of wear & tear due to its age, the hotel is clean and well appointed. The breakfast buffet was extensive, well presented and of a very high standard. Probably the best feature of the hotel are the people who work there, absolutely wonderful!! they were extremely helpful and welcoming. nothing was too much trouble. for example we received a message from one of the other hotels on our itinerary was having difficulty with our booking, The concierge (Emmanuelle) made several calls on our behalf and sorted the problem out for us. This was something I didn't expect but it was very much appreciated. Overall we were disappointed to leave the hotel and wished we had been able to stay a few more days. Well done Galle Face Hotel!!!"
"We stayed for two nights at the Galle Face Hotel and would happily have stayed longer.,OK it's vast, and the floors creak, but it's splendid. We had a Landmark Queen Room which was nicely furnished and clean with a comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom. The only thing missing was a balcony, although we did enjoy a sea view.,Everything about the hotel oozes class, from the flower arrangements in reception to murals and artwork, and furniture dotted around the common areas - it's all exceptional.,We found the quality and choice of food for either breakfast or buffet dinner excellent, and although we were only booked in on a B&B basis we ate dinner here twice as we thought the price was most reasonable.,The staff we found to be helpful friendly and very obliging too, that's everyone from the front desk personnel in changing money for small denominations for us, to the lovely gentleman security guard firing at rooks with his catapult.,The pool is great too. OK it's salt water, but is a big pool and quite deep too and seems clean and well looked after. Maybe the gents shower area here could do with a bit of an update though.,The grounds here are just a magnificent place to watch the sun go down too.,Complaints? - can't think of any, so we'd be delighted to have the chance to stay here again....superb!"
We were on holiday in Colombo but just visited the bar for a couple of cocktails. Pricey compared to other establishments but lovely cocktails and nothing compared to London prices ! Beautiful views . Afternoon tea looked good too ! I had a Colombo spice gin. Friendly staff . 
"This magnificent, restored, Colonial Hotel, is a great place to stay while in this lovely country, you feel pampered as soon as you walk in the doors. Breakfast is epic, rooms are stunning, tastefully decorated, very comfortable beds, and stunning rugs on old polished floors, staff are superb"
"I love breakfast, I'm a breakfast buff, it's the best part of the day. The mind is fresh and hungry... At the Galle Face Hotel you can eat with all senses. This place is full of history and so well maintained for over 100 years, it's unbelievable. Harrison Ford dined and stayed amongst all the other film stars, presidents and musicians. The breakfast speed is divine with a choice of juices from heaven and even king coconut water filled and chilled in jugs. Pancakes, hoppers, idly, waffles, porridge, fruit (including rose apple when in season) and gluten free raspberry muffins. Please can I have breakfast forever!!!!"
"I didn’t stayed at this hotel but I had to write a review about their helpful staff.,Since my arrival all the staff was extremely helpful and courteous.,I needed to contact someone by phone and Mrs Yvone from the reception desk was spectacular!! She not only called my tour company but made sure my driver was outside before I got there.,Many hotels would not considering help someone that is not a guest but this one it was an exception.,I definitely would stay here when I come back to Colombo."
"The hotel was like stepping back to the colonial era. They say it was the best hotel east of the Suez n i tend to agree,We had rm2054 a twin share.it had a huge balcony with good views across the harbour n city.The bathroom was modern with a separate wc. The room had ac and a ceiling fan The buffet dinner and breakfast were great and there was a free happy hour 5.30- 7.00 The pool was huge although very salty n they had a reasonable gym, steam room, sauna ,spa as well as extensive massage therapy rooms.I could easily live there and cant wait to go back!"
This hotel is the most fantastic. You can feel the history at the high tea was perfect. I am a vegetarian and they could make a nice high tea for me. The pool and pool bar direct to the see was fantastic. I love this place!!!
"This is a first rate Hotel. Totally and well modernised Colonial Building with extremely high standards of service, food, management and accommodation. This is an historic building and is beautifully maintained.,This is a must if you are staying in Colombo and are prepared to spend a totally fair but highish rate for accommodation.,The food is first rate and there is a great deal of choice from Buffet to a la carte and eating round the pool or in the ""with it"" bar above the beach.,It is extremely well managed and all the staff are first rate. Nothing is too much trouble which is as it should be.,If I have one niggle it would be that the Check In was laboriously slow and tedious which is a bore at 2pm in the afternoon after a long journey with children when one had booked 3 weeks in advance.,This is as good as any 5 star Hotel I have stayed in in London and I would definitely include it if I was to travel to Sri Lanka again. I recommend it."
"This legendary hotel has it all: History, location, impressing decor, great food, a 30 m swimming pool and a beautiful sea view. But it also has slow and absent service at breakfast - had to ask for coffee three times to mention one example - and loud music throughout all of the hotel until 11.30pm. And no beach at all, if you’re imagining that."
"We went to have a walk in the afternoon to see the sunset and had a lovely chat with the locals. Sunday is bit crowded with locals so be there on weekdays to have a good walk and relax.,We will be back to here when we comes to colombo again."
"Following a long and tiring flight via Dubai after our initial flight was cancelled, we were so glad to get to this iconic hotel - albeit in the rain. We had specifically asked for a sea view room, and to be fair, we could see the sea from the side window. It wasn’t until we came to get to sleep that we found that the room was on the front corner overlooking a busy and noisy roundabout !,Although the management offered to change the room for  us for the second night, it didn’t seem worth the inconvenience just for one night.,It was just a shame that we weren’t put into a proper sea view room which overlooked the beach.,The buffet dining in the Veranda restaurant was very good, and we were able to enjoy the pool on the final afternoon.,The staff were all very obliging and helpful.,It was fascinating to go round their ‘museum’ ( hall of fame), and imagine just how grand it would have been in its heyday.,It is a large hotel with considerable charm - just get a room away from the main road."
"This is an iconic and very nice hotel, the breakfast and breakfast area is really lovely.,We were there for 1 night after landing from France early afternoon. We were put in a room on the 3rd floor and heard a lot of loud music mid afternoon, I phoned reception and they told me it would stop soon (it didn't) when we came back about 10pm and ready to go to bed the noise was really loud...after complaining we were moved to the 2nd floor to a really great room with a huge terrace overlooking Galle face which was nice. Point is that they knew there was a big and noisy reception going on above the 3rd floor but still put people there! Nice that they moved us quickly and to such a nice room, but...."
"This classic hotel's architecture reminds me of the famous Raffles in Singapore albeit much smaller. We only went there one evening for drinks and dinner so I haven't visited the rooms. But the antique furniture in the lobby, and the sunset over the ocean certainly look worth it."
"This is a great place to stay in Colombo, it’s on the ocean but within easy reach of the city centre by tuktuk, and it’s good for a stroll around Galle Green.,We had a room with ocean view - well worth booking this. ,Service was very good, pool a decent size but difficult to find shade at some times during the day so we retired to the adjacent pool bar for beers and snacks!,The main Veranda Restaurant is good, and has a great view, but was really busy and a bit chaotic when we were there for dinner; they focus on their buffet but will do a la carte if you are sufficiently insistent!,If we return to Colombo we will return to the Galle Face."
What an experience ! What a setting! A brilliant experience overall watching the sun go down and a flag ceremony to accompany the whole thing. Brilliant planned by the hotel team. Try the tea buffet.they leave a large three tier stand on your table full of good bite sized food.
