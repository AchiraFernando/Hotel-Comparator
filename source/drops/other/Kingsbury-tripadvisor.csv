"Kingsbury Hotel was one of the hotels that was affected by the recent Easter bombings in Sri Lanka. However on our visit to this splendid hotel during the month of May 2019, we did not see any effects of these attacks. ,The hotel functioned smoothly and we did not at any time during our stay feel either worried or troubled.,There was a scanner at the front entrance and the staff was extremely professional in scanning our belongings to ensure the safety of the residents.,As to the Hotel, it is located in the heart of the city, but with a beach view and is luxurious.  We stayed on the 9th floor, which floor had a separate lounge for either relaxing or business activities ,The staff in the hotel are very friendly and helpful.,The swimming pool is under maintenance and as such we did not use the pool, but was offered the use of the Hilton Pool,We have stayed at other hotels in Colombo, this being the first time at Kingsbury and would definitely visit this hotel in our next visit and highly recommend it "
"We have been regulars at the Hotel everytime we visit Colombo for a casino trip. Room wise, their Standard rooms are literal as per the name - very ""Standard"" in size and equipped with standard aminities a 5 star offer. The Suite rooms are nothing short of a palace. The bedroon has glass walls on 3 sides offering a gorgeous view of the sea. They have recently opened Celavi on the rooftop. Those hailing from Singapore/Hongkong/KL would instantly know the name as its a chain of open air (mostly rooftop) restaurants offering amazing food and amazing view of the city."
"I was very impressed by the staff of this hotel, from the warm welcome to the smiling faces that accompanied every service provided. Of course the recent bomb attack would have had it's impact on them, mental trauma included but still they didn't forget to smile. This is a very beautiful property located in the best part of Colombo and has every amenity needed and gorgeous city views. Thank you for a wonderful stay at your amazing hotel. "
"I had many meals at the Grill and Other restaurants at the Kingsbury. The food is the best. Even better than certain international hotel chains in Sri Lanka. ,Do try their buffets. Out of this world. My review is to commend (Hi5) the management. ,You indeed were very professional in handling my refund. Sad we could not have the planned post-wedding brunch on the 28th due to the deadly explosions. Yet the way you handled my request and the speediness of the refund speaks very well for you and Sri Lanka. ,I have no hesitation in recommending The Grill and THE OCEAN SEAFOOD RESTAURANT. Excellent for group dining. The Cuisine is delicious. The customer service of Management Top Notch."
And also they lock the minibar so my wife couldn't put my little son milk inside the fridge. However it was good experience for us to stay at Kingsbury hotel that placed in the central of Colombo. I will stay at the hotel again
Yesterday night was my brothers wedding ceremony.what a beautiful amazing hotel it was.just truly mad by its amazing staff.special thanks to our wedding coordinator MR.THAMEERA woh gave us great support from the beginning to the end to make our ceremony a beautiful one.also another big thank to the banquet captain MR.CHAMINDA who helped us a lot with his great staff.i truly recommend anyone to stay or to have any events at knigs bury hotel with the amazing and supportive staff around.thanking once more to kingsbury who assists us from the very beginning until the end to make our ceremony  fantastic one.
"I loved lots of things about this hotel.  The room was too narrow but overall had tons of space, a whole dressing area and a really great bathroom.  I loved the shower!  We had a great dinner at the Chinese restaurant and the staff was so nice.  They even let us leave our luggage for three extra days while we headed out to tea country.  Despite the terror attack they are still open for business and I highly recommend them and would stay again."
"We stayed at this stunning hotel for three days at the end of our stay in Sri Lanka.  From check in to check out, three days later, we had an amazing time. Exceptional service, accommodations and dining at the restaurant. Staff are absolutely welcoming and consistently pleasant.  A special thank you to Chef Jayasuriya and his team who went out of his way to accommodate us and make things extra special.,I write this with a heavy heart in light of recent events in the news concerning the horrendous attack and my thoughts are with all those at this amazing hotel. We will be back."
"We stayed in The Kingsbury for one night a week before the attack. The reception were absolutely fantastic. We left a card in a cash machine at the airport and they sorted it all out for us. I don’t know the name of the particularly lovely guy who calmed down a very jet-lagged and anxious guest, but I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thinking of you all."
Today was holiday for me went out for lunch at 12.15 pm they had a buffet variety of selection to choose it's was amazing the food is awesome and we all enjoyed very much. I would recommend anyone to visit this place.
"We toured Sri Lanka for 10 days and stayed one at the Kingsbury on our last night before taking our flight from Colombo.,I'd like to thank the hotel for the beautiful birthday cake on arrival.,This is a cracking hotel in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of an amazing city.,Views from the bar on top of the hotel are fantastic and a must.,We ate in the fish restaurant and I must say it was the best meal we ate in Sri Lanka. We picked own fish and asked chef to cook it how we wanted. Lobster thermidor was so fresh. Bottle of white win and two fantastic courses 14,000 rps!!,We've stayed in some posh hotels in London, this has the same feel and quality without the offer priced drinks and food London charge.,I highly recommend this hotel if staying in area and wished we had been there longer."
The staff here are excellent. Perfect English spoken .  Good Buffet choices. Pool area beautiful & Honeys Beach Club relaxing for evening. Amazing view from room. Reclaimed land in front only downside with diggers working away.
"So much to choose from including Sri Lankan and western style dishes. I particularly liked thdd asparagus soup. Very creamy and tasty. There was also a really nice potato and sdpinach curry I liked. I tried small amounts of several dishes and enjoyed everything. I wasn't staying at the hotel so didn't see the rooms. I just went there for dinner. A good location and there were big displays of red roses in the foyer... maybe there was a function planned, or maybe they do it all the time. It looked like a nice quality hotel."
"Stayed at this very well kept beautifull hotel for 2 nights with family.,Amazing hospitality helped me to recover my lost money from a local driver though it had no concerns with hotel team. Great food, service well kept rooms and amenities. The multiple  restaurants provide an arrey of cuisines.,Rooms with a view if galle or ocean."
It's almost the best hotel around the place. Customer relationship is really excellent and very pleasing. The honey beach restaurant is very nice and the out door is really amazed the evening. Staffs are really attentive a big thanks to Mr. Farooz for your Hospitality.
"Great place to stay on route to the airport. Clean, great facilities and welcoming team. Watching the sunset by the Pool, buffet and rooftop bar were all highlights. Thanks and look forward to next time."
"My husband and I stayed here two nights celebrating a friends birthday. ,The pool area has a great atmosphere; even though it’s now surrounded by the port which used to be a beach. ,The room was immaculate. Once blinds/drapes closed room is literally pitch black which has its pros and cons, luckily we didn’t sleep in! ,Bathroom was spacious and provided amenities were of a generous size."
"I came at the evening with my friend to have a little drink into the bar called the king's bar and when we came in pawara we'll come in a great way we was shocked for his we'll come and he gave us a nice table and seatad us he was we're friendly and Soo helpful his service was great  we are really tank full for his service .........,Tanks a lot for everything pawara we will surely come to see again tnx a lot"
"We were only here for one night after our flight. The location is good, staff fine. If you get chance walk across the road to the Old Dutch Hospital where there are a number of bar's and restaurants. We would return."
Stayed here recently for our first night in Sri Lanka. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I had requested where possible to have a room overlooking the Galle Face Green which was kindly granted. The breakfast was very good and the hotel is located near to many bars and restaurants. Their roof top bar was a nice place to have a drink in the evening.
"We had a great time while enjoying a wonderful meal. Great food, and nice atmosphere. Customer service is really nice and friendly. Verity of desserts are mouths watering. Looking forward to going there again, in a few months."
"Great stay, excellent service with very nice people. The room and the hotel is good but not the best 5* hotel in the world, but the service and the people working there are very nice, helpful, they really care about you, and it makes the difference with other hotels. Nothing to complain during that stay. Thank you very much. Compliments to Glen at the Executive Lounge, to Nishani at the Business Center, Valerian at the Front Office, and to the rest of the staff."
We came for high tea . Reservation was handled very well. Calling and reconfirming was great. Reservation table was in a good location. Eight of our family members are enjoying the great food at this moment at the hotel.
My husband and I enjoyed our high tea but considering the new port is being built in front of the Kingsbury their is no ocean view.  High Tea was an amazing spread of everything from savoury to sweet. No need for dinner that night.
"Nice rooms, very big breakfast buffet, the swimming pool is pretty big, the view amazing! The personnel was very friendly. You must have a drink at the roof and enjoy the sunset! We went for a yoga retreat with my friends and had a marvelous time!"
My family of 5 stayed in 2 rooms and due to an injury on the trip we needed an upgrade which was able to be provided.  The location is good but you should note that Colombo is not made for walking but driving.  Since the construction going on with reclaimed land the hotel needs to build a big fence at the end of the pool to block this - think garden or trompe l'oeil.  The inside restaurants are freezing - you will need a jacket - I have never understood this tendency to over air-con - works well to make me leave faster.
"Very convience location- from hotel to coast, we just need 5 mins walking. ,Comfortable and nice hotel. Specially there was huge buffet for dinner with hundreds dishes: Indian, Srilankan, International, also vegeterian... ,Remember in Srilanka, they charge you drinks with more expensive than normal cuz alcohol tax here is truly high, in the other hand food was kinda cheap there "
"Not knowing quite what to expect from Colombo we were very pleasantly surprised by this hotel.  Very courteous and efficient staff, our room not ready on arrival so an instant upgrade. Great way to start.  This hotel is in a great part of town, plenty of trending places in the lanes around the Dutch district to eat and drink pity we are only here for one night.,The highlight though is the biggest buffet in the world, maybe the universe and at around $25AUD a head how can you resist.,Highly recommend.  ,There is though a downside, expansion/reclamation of the foreshore in front of the hotel will mean in the next few years what was once beachfront, will eventually be back streets, pity really, so visit soon."
Stayed at this hotel only for one night. Location was great if you like to explore the city and close to the sea. The roof terrace has a great view. Room not so spacious but clean. Lamp switches were a mystery and no hooks to hang things in the bathroom was a minus. Breakfast buffet had a good selection. We would stay here again.
Hotel has a wonderful selection of food in their buffet- beautifully prepared and fresh. We enjoyed the peaceful surroundings of the pool in the middle of the busy city. Friendly Pryantha the concierge looked after us and we enjoyed our chat about life saving in our two countries.
"A lovely hotel with modern finishings.   The rooms are well appointed and have all the amenities one requires.   I particularly like the Bulgari toiletries which was a nice touch.   The view from the rooms is lovely  - a little bit of city with the sea.   Staff were very helpful and the check in was quick.   ,The location is great - a few minutes walk from the beach as well as Colombo's nightlife and restaurants.   The view from the rooftop bar / restaurant is great, as are the cocktails."
"We chose this hotel late last year from the website photos and anticipated a beach-front three days of leisure.  What a total shock.  The beach vanished long ago thanks to a billion dollar Chinese land-reclamation development.  The Kingsbury, and indeed the whole Colombo esplanade, has lost its beach. Check out the photos.,What a tragedy for the city.  But the Kingsbury should stop conning customers like us with untruthful photos on their website."
"Terrible IT Service, My TV was not worked during my entire 2 days and , IT guy's are coming and going back no solutions, Wifi is same. saying Wifi Free but useless service,Atleast to should keep inform guest what about the issue and appologise . no one came to room and its waisted my entire office work due to this useless IT service, 3 different guys came from IT including manager and no solutions. its a shame 5 star property having this kind of silly service,Terrible not recommending this hotel to Business users."
"Need to improve the customer care, overall room service, engineering divisions pro active measures need to be improved. Overall not be a money making center and customer oriented. Room facilities should be improved. Such as complimentary items from the visit to the hotel. "
"Great hotel annd excellent location in Colombo! The staff is very helpful & courteous too!,Except... we had many mosquitos in the room, and despite several requests they did not look at sorting this problem out. Also they gave us a room on the second floor (which they call Priviledge Floor) with a balcony.. great view & everything! However sadly every morning they would be washing the hotel windows and without any prior notice to the guests the water would fall on us from above when we were sitting on the balcony! Despite complaining the same thing happened every morning...... so beware don't ask for room on the second floor! Sad that a hotel of such stature dealt with the guests in such a manner..."
"Was here for a wedding and to see Colombo. This hotel is right in the middle of where you want to be to see the sights in Colombo- The Presidential buildings are next door, markets, St Anthony's cathedral, temples, CCC (Shopping centre) and Galle face (park) are all within walking distance or 5-10 mins by tuk tuk. The area is SAFE.,THe actual hotel though, has the feel of an upper market hotel with piano room, pool (kids pool as well). The only drama is sometimes the lift wasn't working and service was hit and miss. If you are using this as a base camp to head out then you've chosen well. They are reclaiming land next door so this location will only intensify itself as the heart of the tourist region."
"The hotel has an old world charm with an exquisite lobby and fabulous service. The rooms, especially the ones with sea view are excellent, bathroom amenities are bvulgari! Morning bfast on coffee shop has perhaps the largest assortment of food I've seen at a hotel around the world!!"
"Found on my first visit not so five star, as we were a couple, there were one tooth brush, one towel, one of everything. But on my second visit a week later it was much better and I would now give it the Five Star it deserves. "
A well located hotel close to most central things in Colombo. Nice interior and good restaurant both for breakfast (full and comprehensive buffet) and dinner. The pool is very nice and looks over what is left of the sea view (building work reclaiming land blocks it). Room was a touch small and showing signs of age with air con very loud and light comming in through the door at night however it was very comforable and the bed and shower were excellent. Staff were great and due to location i'd definatley stay here again.
The people at this hotel are so kind and helpful and that is just the beginning. The room was perfect and the facilities are equally amazing. The pool area was perfect for kids and adults. The food is incredible and the spa was peaceful and affordable. You owe it to yourself to visit this hotel. ️️️
"True to its name, the hotel provides an overall nice experience to the customers. Excellent multi cuisine restaurant & a chinese specialty restaurant. However, the view from Hotel got deteriorated due to Port city coming right in front of the property obstructing sea view."
I stayed for 2 weeks here for my first time on a work trip. I was given a beautiful room with stunning views of the Galle face and couldn't have been made to feel more welcome and comfortable. All the staff are amazing! The bed was so comfortable and the vibe of the hotel is fantastic for both business and pleasure. I would recommend for anyone that wants to enjoy the wonderful Sri lankan hospitality 
We planned a surprise birthday party for our friend and Anusha who works at the high tea lounge helped us a-lot and she was very friendly and her service was perfect. Had a great time and the food was really good.
"My husband and I stayed at the Kingsbury for 2 nights. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite. Room had a funky smell but everything was clean. We had chocolates set up in our room which was a nice touch. Breakfast buffet was great each morning with a great variety. We at dinner at the Oceans Seafood restaurant and it was ok, nothing outstanding in our opinion. Roof top bar had an amazing view & great cocktails. The staff throughout the property were amazing except the pool staff. They did not understand our English at all & service was slow (not many people at the pool when we were there). The gym is quiet small but has all you need for a workout while on holiday, clean with water bottles at all stations. The location of the hotel was perfect for a short stay in Colombo."
"Overall we were pleased with this hotel which we booked at short notice due to another property letting us down.  I think my only gripe was that I contacted them three times through their website to book a meal for my wife’s birthday which would be on the evening that we arrived. I never received a response and had to arrange it when we checked in. A staff member helped us but the restaurant was full and we had to book for a table in a foyer area. Reluctantly we accepted this. They need to get their communications with customers sorted.,It is reasonably located to the Colombo Fort station and we walked there with our bags in 10-15 mins. The staff will direct you."
"i was there in march 2018 with my friend.the hotel has very good location.the staff are very friendly and helpful .at first our room was very noisy , when i asked reception  ,they changed the room very soon. the hotel lounge was very beautiful.the breakfast was very varied from local food to international.rooms very nice clean and have comfortable beds. i liked the hotel and recommend it."
"- Rooms: from bad to worse, no internet, strange woman in the noisy corridor, ,- pool: too loud music to relax as of 11 am,I wd not recommend this hotel, neither as a 5 star hotel, nor as a place where to relax"
"We spent our last 2 nights in lovely Sri :Lanka at the Kingsbury in Colombo. It offers good value for money, rooms are modern and well furnished, with a terrific rain-shower. However, I did not like the mirror wall in the cramped bathroom, off-putting and crass IMHO. Housekeeping needs improvement, no spare toilet roll, no tissue box, towels taken away but not replaced etc. All provided promptly on request, but that should not be necessary.,Breakfast buffet is excellent with good service, coffee/tea poured at the table. Situated at one end of Galle Face ( other end is Galle Face Hotel), adjacent to the massive Fort City project, construction of which will start soon.,Check-in staff assured us that our rooms ( 205/215) would have a view, turned out to be completely untrue; they could have been honest upfront, and told us that rooms with views were not available. Check-in also took an inordinately long time, the cinnamon-ginger drink offered while we waited was wonderful but served in thimble-sized glasses."
"We have spent three nights in this establishment and absolutely loved it from the location, to the executive lounge and floor, to the service. The hotel has a lovely bar on the rooftop and the Japanese restaurant is truly recommended. The room was cozy, and the buffet breakfast was awesome in terms of choice and quality. Will return!"
"We stayed in the Kingsbury two nights before we flew on to the next stop on our leg. Overall, the location is great, really close to a lot of the amenities. The hotel itself is well presented, the room was really comfortable, if needing a little lick of paint here and there to sharpen it up.,Check-in / reception were really friendly, as were the bell boys. It lacked a little polish to make it stand out amongst other 5 star hotels, but for the price, it's a really great hotel.,One slight demerit was that our window didn't have the greatest of seals, so when they had the DJ on (Friday night), it was fairly loud in our room. It stopped at 11 though, so not the end of the world!"
"I do really appreciate the service that was rendered by the crew regards to the hospitality provided during the event of commencement.I really make this as a gratitude for all the members for their enormous support for service provided.they were spiritually into the duty with a customer adherence commitment towards the guess in entertaining and serving.I my self would like to personally appreciate Mr.Raveen (who working in the CÉ LA VI) for the tendency of serving the guess to highest peak with much responsiable and gusture.And i would finally delicate the tastious food served as they were very much pleasant and was very dellicious.I hereby would remark and recommand #KINGSBURY #COLOMBO for the great service experiance. ,Thank u verymuch.You all made my day special,09th feb 2019"
"Best Location in Fort Colombo, Comfortable beds , Luxury Bvlgari toiletries in room , Elaborate breakfast buffet with good choices .Conciage very helpfull .Overall had a great stay with nothing to complain."
"This was our first stop on our SL trip. The hotel had a very colonial feel. ,Decent size room. ,Breakfast was great. Lots of choice and all well prepared. ,The hotel was also located in a reasonably good area within waking distance to restaurants and curio shops. "
"This hotel is over rated. ,Some of the staff members are good but most of them need some basic ethics.,No towels when I cheked-in, called the house keeping two times on the first day to bring it for me. On the second day, I was away for 4 hours with the instruction to get my room make up through turning on the notification light ouside the room but returned with room not being touched. Asked the staff working nearby and he came after 20 mins.,Again the towels were not provided and had to call housekeeping many times for the same and finally got it in the evening.,Just two complimentary water bottles were provided on the first day nothing on the second day.,Room was given near backyard of the hotel with a view of the car park.,All together a very bad experience at this property."
"Thank you for your email , we had a good relaxed time at your Hotel facility and yes we defiantly recommend to friends and family to your destination and will give a 9 out of 10 for satisfaction good services all around except for the Honey comb restaurant bar services was not good at all slow and no customer care , my special thanks to the concierge manager who was extremely helpful and very well mannered "
"Hotel with nice environment. The service needs improvement for a 5 stars hotel. On the third day of staying, a room cleaning staff just shout at my door while I am showering and the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign is on. On the last day, check-out is a frustrating process. The computer system is down they took a long time to settle the check-out. Ordered in-room dining but the receipt is no where to be found. Even though I have given my credit card information for any additional charges. I am still being charged of the in-room dining. The service level is not acceptable for a 5 stars hotel."
"Kingsbury is one of the best places to have good food around Colombo in the 5 Star level. Specially the Kingsbury high tea is worth for its price. It is buffet and there are so many varieties. The customer service is also superb. You can try different kind of dishes from its restaurants like Harbor court, Gourmot station,Honey beach club etc."
Been travelling to Colombo for last 3 years now and have stayed in Kingsbury twice. The hotel location is apt and good areas to wall around at night. The hotel pool side becomes very lively at night time which makes it all more interesting and happening.  Food and customer service is worth the money spent. Some time you would feel the lobby is over crowded which doesn't gives a feel of 5star properly. Other then that all is good and worth it. 
"We visited on our first visit to Sri Lanka several years ago and thought it was a great hotel with great service so when returning to Sri Lanka this year we decided to stay here for our one night in Colombo.  It didn’t start well and went downhill from there.  Check-in wasn’t easy although some of that may have been due to linguistic problems and the noise in the reception area.  The corridor to our rooms in a no smoking area smelt of cigarette smoke though the rooms didn’t.  A suitcase lock was damaged, the restaurant service in the buffet restaurant was at best poor.  The wine we ordered was out of stock, no problem, but when told this we weren’t given the wine list back to chose an alter but had to ask for it. Plates from the table weren’t cleared and we had to move them to another table to ensure we had space for our ongoing meal.  At check-out we had to wait whilst they checked if we’d used the minibar but we couldn’t use it as padlocked.,Highlights were the service in the rooftop bar “Ce la Vi” which was excellent and the chief porter Hussain in resolving our problems with suitcase lock who couldn’t have been more helpful or attentive.  Sadly should we return to Colombo in the future we’ll give the Kingsbury a big miss."
"Very good location , take a walk around the place in the evening, close to the beachside and other side you have the heritage buildings, opposite to the hotel is Dutches Hospital building which has lots of pubs and bars and a must place to visit. Sea food lovers should visit restaurant in this building called MINISTRY OF CRABS, which is owned by the famous cricketers Manila Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara,it’s just awesome.,Kingsbury Hotel Duty Manager Mr. Vishal is very helpful in making the guests comfortable and by meeting you personally to see to your needs."
"As we arrived we were warmly welcomed by the staff.Staff was excellent, extremely helpful.The kings offers an extensive cocktail menu.,Special thanks to Mr Thilina who take care of the place ,Ideal location for a different vibe will definitely recommend to anyone."
"We stayed at the Kingsbury for New Year’s Eve and watched the fireworks directly above us from the rooftop bar. We had to book tickets and pay extra to be on the rooftop, food and drinks all inclusive, but it was worth doing. The staff at the hotel are very helpful. The rooms are great, the breakfast outstanding, and the pool is very good. Overall, a very good hotel."
"The hotel is great place for business stop over. The renovation of some parts of the hotel is in progress. The hotel offers SPA services, gems, souvenir and tea shop. At the hotel there is an event facilities. It great to come back and stay at the hotel. Friendly staff ready to help you any moment."
"A beautiful hotel in the city center. Close to shops, markets and eateries. The buffet spread was AMAZING!! The service was impeccable and I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat. The pool was huge and open late. The bar and dj played music till late at night which was nice for those on holiday. View of the port and a main road. The interior of the hotel was luxurious down to the bathroom supplies being from BLVGARI. The rooms were large and all level 2 rooms had a balcony which was stunning to relax in. The rooftop bar was beautiful but you need to be 18+ to enter which was difficult when my party had 8 adults and a 1 year old. There was a range of shops available onsite and the reception staff were fantastic."
"Stayed one night at the  hotel, its convenient to the heart of Colombo. There are many restaurants within the  hotel and  my personal favorites are the  roof top bar and the Grill on the  ground floor. The buffet is ideal for a crowd.  there are many restaurants near to the  hotel which makes it ideal if you want a change from the  norm."
"Our fourth stay at the Kingsbury...Colombo. Love this hotel. First stay was in 1992, when it was The Inter Continental. 2015, 2017, and this year 2019. We will be back! Great shopping at Paradise Road and the Majestic Arcade."
"I stayed for two nigghts in the Kingsbury Hotel as part of a tour of Sri Lanka. ,The reception, the restaurant and the common parts in general are very nice, clean, welcoming and well-kept. Both the reception area and the restaurant were superbly decorated for Christmas and the New Year.,The room was nice but rather small. It had all amenities, but the impression was that it would benefit from a general refurbishment.,Staff was helpful.,Food was good and there was a good choice for both breakfast and dinner."
"On January 14th I checked in at the Hilton and due to an error in my booking I have to cut my stay short and book in to Kingsbury on the 14 of January. The Hilton is only 3 minutes walking from the Hilton but I had a luggage and an elderly companion,So we decided to take a three wheeler to avoid the scorching sun and lugging our large suitcases all the way against the traffic.,On nearing the main entrance the three wheeler driver stop the short., I motioned him to proceed to the main entrance for easier disembark . The Kingsbury security guard motioned that three wheelers are not allowed past this area .,I told him I've suitcases and I'm going to check in.,He was looking at me like. "" hey what's wrong with you.  He pointed to a signboard that says no tuk tuk beyond this point. ,It puzzles me why paying guests are not allowed to be dropped off at the main entrance. ,Its an insult and an embarrassment for me,This discriminatory action is difficult for me to comprehend "
"We stayed one night as we wanted to go around Colombo after being in southern Sri Lanka for 2 weeks. ,The pics are not representative to what we have experienced.,They have placed us in a room where the view has a terrace.Simply horrible.,There was also very noisy. The room service very-very slow.,Food was good and the buffet had great range of goodies.,Concierge service was great and the shops and the layout at the ground floor (reception area) was nothing you were in another hotel. The piano, the fish tank, the design gives you a great atmosphaire and then you walk to the room and you are questioning yourself.....?!,The manager was happy to change us to another room but having to stay for 1 day it was more of a hassle doing so.,I think during check-in they should of told us before placing us at the specific room."
"A nice hotel very next to the beach front, located in the CBD and very easy to reach anywhere in Colombo. Rooms are nice and clean, a little smaller than some of the other hotels but of course not too small. Has got good breakfast and lunch spreads. With the rooftop bar and restaurant makes it even better. I would definitely come back again."
Great location in Colombo it is a very comfortable hotel . Rooms are a little small but very comfortable and the facilities are first class. As usual we found the staff very friendly and helpful. Food was very good
"love the hotel,  we have just stayed at this again our third time for 5 days.,The food and the staff are very friendly.  ideal location on the Galle front in Columbo.,the only thing i did not like this time was the loud music everynight  from the Honey club pool bar every night.,sunday lunch are a must here."
"A big thank you to the hotel staff for making my stay over 2 weeks enjoyable. All the staff are really friendly from reception staff to the restaurant staff.  Further, I did leave back some items on my departure but the hotel staff handled it professionally and ensure everything was returned to me. ,Also a special thank you for the Chef Jayasuriya (I think I got it right) and the cleaning team on the 7th floor, (Chanka and team) who always talks to you and smiles at all times. ,I must also state I noted several instances where the staff were treated badly by some guests (especially Indians) however they respected the customer and handled the issue professionally, It sad as everyone should be respected on what job they do. ,Once again thank you, Team Kingsbury. Highly recommended hotel. I do tours for friends in Sydney and I will ensure I give you a plus on the tour.,Last but not least thanks to Denesh Silva and Hasitha (reservations) for organising all the smaller things before the date of arrival."
"My husband & I stayed in the hotel and celebrated Danish Christmas Dinner.,We had Dinner in the Japanese Restaurant which was not that impressive food. In fact my husband got the Steak chopped into small pieces which he sent back to the kitchen. Hotel Room was a nice & cleaned.,We enjoyed drinks in 2 bars which were also ok.,Most of all we like the location since the hotel is located just in front of the Galle Face Green facing Indian Ocean. Sadly our day 1 was raining therefore we couldn’t enjoy a walk on the beautiful Galle Face Green.,Breakfast was ok mixed with few cuisines but majority of the breakfast items were Indian & Sri Lankan, therefore for Westerners not that much good unless they like those food."
We celebrate birthday in coffee shop on 5th January.well trained staff and friendly and professional staff.lots of variety of food and taste and quality was excellent. Special thanks for tharindu and Eshan from kitchen.will back soon and keep it up good wirk
"Came here for drinks with friends on a pub crawl. Service was fantastic. ,unfortunately, the great views from the restaurants are now lost due to the development of the port city. nonetheless, great service."
"Stayed here for 4 nights 30/12/18 to 3/01/19. Good location, excellent facilities and high standard of service especially in renovated floors and superior executive rooms. (Thank you for the complimentary upgrade).,Great staff. Comfortable and clean rooms, nice pool and dining options.,Not my first stay at Kingsbury.,Like most SL hotels, peak period room rates are higher than comparable rates in other SE Asian destinations.,Restaurant prices a bit on the high side.,Minor comment - Noticed a few small cockroaches around the place, even in the spa room! Can be a common problem in tropical climates and not restricted to this hotel. Perhaps regular pest control will fix this before it gets out of hand.,Will stay here again as it is a great property with excellent staff, facilities and service!"
"We weren't staying in the hotel but popped in for a drink and a bite at lunchtime and were made to feel extremely welcome even though my partner was in shorts (in contrast to many of the big hotels on this strip). We ate in the bar and I had a great spiced mango cocktail, my partner loved the cold beer, and we had a selection of tapas. Not cheap but tasty and in lovely environment with friendly staff. ,Having has such a nice experience we returned for dinner (in long pants!) And had amazing steaks in The Grill - better cooked than many I've had in London. Finished off with a nightcap in the rooftop bar where a great singer was performing. ,All in all a lovely, friendly experience with great food and cocktails. Warm atmosphere unlike sterile feel of many corporate hotels. Thanks for making us feel so welcome."
"Baked crab was delicious and generous serve for < AUS$15. Cocktails lacked presentation but tasted great and very reasonably priced. Lovely poolside eating area. Friendly staff everywhere, esp at jewellers in foyer. Helpful but not pushy. "
"My maiden visit  to Colombo and what better than Kingsbury. Wonderful Property. Location is perfect, right in the middle of the city. Honey Beach Club is awesome. My recommendations do spend time by the pool side. "
"Undoubtedly the best lunch buffet spread in town , you name it they have . Indian , Japanese , Internatinoal to anything you need. They have great spread of sea food also typical Sri Lanka curries too. I just loved every minute. Service was really nice and helpful. Try go their on a Saturday , you will love it"
Fabulous hotel. Amazing pool and bar on the lower and a roof top bar for evening cocktails. Beautiful rooms. Gourmet chocolates on arrival was a pleasant surprise. Walk to the water front. Great markets and bars around.
"I actually didn't stay at this hotel. The interactions during the booking g.pricess were sufficient for me to the rethink and rebook else where. ,The booking manager was rude and condescending and communication by email so cahllenging I ended up calling, but again was met with condescension. I booked the Taj.,Try it, you might like it! "
"I felt welcome from the moment I walked into the Kingsbury. Excellent customer service. Great food, beautiful room! The spa is amazing. Go to Honeys at the pool its fun at night live music, food and drinks. So happy with our experience, cant wait to go back."
First trip to Sri Lanka great first impression given by Kingsbury. Mohammed from Exec lounge top chap. Breakfast impressive. Rooms super comfortable. Pool lacked privacy and natural shading but I'm being picky here.
This is my first time in Sri Lanka and i don't know what the quality means here. I have chosen this hotel and it was very nice but i can't tell this price matches the quality. i expected much more quality just like i have experienced in Swiss-hotel in Singapore. You cannot find so much variety of breakfast. Also at night the music in the pool bar disturbs you even you are in the 5th floor.  
Very comfortable hotel. Well presented throughout. There are a handful of different restaurants to choose from and a roof top bar. The honey is a  relaxing outdoor pool side with bar and food available. Staff are very friendly. Centrally located.
staff was very friendly and the food selection was off the charts. However i think they have over done the salad bar. I would spend more time on quality than quantitiy. Breads were really fresh. The main items were excellent. I've been here for breakfast too. Those few times were amazing and well worth the price.
"Its a great hotel for relaxing..  ,Amazing breakfast....good people and amazing pool.. great pizza and pasta,They honey bar has great vine and its a relaxing space,Comfortable beds nice dark rooms , you can even select a different pillow to sleep on each night ..they have a spa and a steam room"
"When you enter this hotel you are confronted with an enormous entrance hall that exudes quality with marble floors, chandeliers and enormous vases of fresh roses.. Staff open the main doors for you and nothing is too much trouble. Given the quality, the room prices by UK standards are exceptional value. The room that I had was quite small and a little tired. Having said that the bed linen was good and the bed itself very comfortable. Facilities were very good with a variety of restaurants and bars to suit most tastes."
"This hotel is right in the city business district, but has a great outlook over the sea and along the Galle Green. It is an older 5 star hotel, Friendly and professional staff. Very satisfied with my stay. I would strongly recommend this hotel. Among the best top 10 hotels in Colombo. Restaurants are excellent."
"Visited The Kingsbury twice in October during a cricket tour my son was on. The rooms in this hotel are very comfortable with absolutely everything that you could need. ,The choice and quality of food in the main restaurant is very good also. We did not visit the restaurant and bar on the roof but we heard it was very good.,The pool area outside is well laid out and we didn't have any trouble getting a sun bed or beanbag. The only problem we encountered was the hit and miss service of food and drink around the pool. Sometimes the staff wanted paying straight away ...sometimes they didn't.  And sometimes when you had paid they would ask you to pay again!! The food and drink around the pool is quite expensive (for Sri Lanka) and the service doesn't meet the cost. Food could take up to 1 hour to arrive also.,Altogether though a lovely hotel and I would like to go back there some day."
"We stayed at The Kingsbury after arriving very late at night into Colombo and then an early departure the next day. The room was clean, quiet and nicely laced out. Showers worked a treat. The food at breakfast was very good and overall service was polite and quick.  This is a nice spot for an overnight layover."
"On our recent visit to Sri Lanka, we were astonished at the array of food at the breakfast spread. Every dish was tasty and there wasn't a single flaw in service either. On the whole, it was a gastronomic experience to remember. Keep up the tempo as it says a lot for your hotel and your country too. Excellent! "
" Service was good this visit recomend the 8th floor because it is less noise.Breakfirst was excelent staff frendly,Enjoyed entertaing frends at the bar .Bar food was good.the room was clean and kept that way by the house keeping staff.the executive lounge staff looked after me so can not complain.will visit next year."
"We had very good time special dinner at main restaurant with colombo city view restaurant staff was friendly helpful I can recommend for any one this restaurant ,The food is very delicious our children enjoyed very much good fun too"
"This is a five star hotel, it has a lot of amenities, beds are super comfy, room size is ok, big TV with a lot of English speaking channels. However, it was chaotic. The lobby was super noisy with people bumping into each other. It seems popular with locals and the place was packed with people. There were a lot of events and weddings happening so I would not recommend going there during weekends. Service was not as good due to this chaos. There were a lot of options at the buffer but food was of average quality. Sort of seemed like mass production. Also it has a big pool but its facing the street and there are loads of constructions taking place so the hotel has lost completely its five star luxury when it comes to its pool area. The rooftop is nice, although again there is view of the constructions taking place"
"I surprised my wife on her Birthday with a Romantic Night at the CeLaVi Restaurant (rooftop) and dont have words to how the night went! I went on a earlier day to discuss a few things with the Restaurant Manager and they really went that extra mile. The food was fantastic, the staff were excellent, the lighting and ambiance was splendid and best of all the views! They had put rose petals and a few balloons and provided us with a personalized VIP service. My wife was simply delighted and swept off her feet with this place. I highly highly recommend you give this place a try! Very Classy and decently priced!,A special note of thanks must be given to Ithusha, Indika and Sandun for making this a unique and memorable experience for both my wife and I. Please keep up the good work and I will most definitely see you all soon!"
Kingsbury overlooks the ocean and many rooms offer partial sea view. The hotel is steeped in luxury and has an old world charm blended nicely with modern luxury. The rooms are slightly on the smaller size but very tastefully done. The breakfast is excellent as is the food at its multiple a la carte restaurants. The Bulgari toiletries is an added bonus.
"It’s the best hotel I have seen. Very comfortable room, the toilette set is amazing. The hotel staff helpful and friendly. The buffet is enormous for breakfast and for dinner time. Swimming pool cold be better, but it’s good. "
