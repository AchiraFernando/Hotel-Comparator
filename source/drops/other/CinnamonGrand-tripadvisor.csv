Echo restaurant has a very calming and romantic atmosphere and the food is excellent. We first visited Echo in 2012 and nothing has changed by now. The service is really good and the staff member Curator Pradeep who served us was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy a good meal in a relaxing environment.
"One of the best Italian Resturant in Colombo ( cinnamon grand).  Got separate smoking seatings. Buffet dinners on Wednesdays, Fridays and  Saturdays. ,Excellent on service most of the time the restaurant managers there to cater you and they got a nice bar too. Nice view of Colombo city from restaurant. ,very bright and brilliant and clean place. All foods monitored by originally Italian star chef. It’s a place for Italian food in Srilanka... "
"The greatest Italian experience. The herbs , breads and of course the menus. and excellent service by curator Pradeep ,Try out grappamisu,Great hospitality and keep up the good work guys , ,Saj. "
"We had a great time at the lagoon.we always come to the lagoon really nice delicious food as always everything smoothly went.,Specially have to thank Eranga and Hashi they takecare us very well.I really enjoyed my day."
"Came for a honeymoon November last year, trying to figure out where to go for our next holiday together and realised all the answers were in sri lanka again! See our review from December 2018.,We both missed the unique experience of Cinnamon Grand so much that we came back for our first holiday of 2019 - service, hospitality and quality is exceptional as always. Special mention to: Leeza, Asanka and Prabath, have made our first day after a long flight as perfect as it can be. Incredible people and very much looking forward to seeing them and the rest of the team for the remainder of the stay. ,We spent every night at the Shisha Lounge in November and plan to do the same for this stay. Very happy to see Priyadanshana and Chadika again - the shisha they make is exceptional and couldn't be recommended any more highly. Their customer service is unbelievable and they make us feel at home again.,Here's hoping that time goes as slowly as possible for the next 8 nights.,Much love to the whole cinnamon grand team! "
Marvellous service and food along with a beautiful wedding of my partners’ Sister wedding. Excellent service provided by Chandimal and team!!! Wouldn’t forget the experience over here for the whole event.
"Business as usual. Great job nirosh weth mangala Cinnomon! Amazing  to see large numbers in restaurants.. good food, excellent service,smiley faces...we had an amazing meal...looking forward to be here soon again..,#srilankan tourism #peace #welcome all!!! :)"
We visited cinnamon grand today after the terrible incident and the security is very good and I can say that it's very safe.As always they served us the best food at noodles and the staff was very friendly.
Came for my sister's wedding and was helped by Chandimal and his team from the concierge lugging around crate after crate of bottles.. even two days after the wedding was over offered to find us boxes to pack everything... Great service team.
"We are so glad to see that #CG  is back to normal and service is BETTER THAN EVER! ,Mr Mangala, Mr. Ranjith, Thushara and Lolita are back at making magic!,Highly recommend Cinnamon Grand as your next dinner/ holiday destination in #srilanka"
"Great atmosphere, people, food and drinks.,Pradeep who looked after us did a brilliant job ensuring that everything was taken care of down to the last detail,Great to see that the crowds are back and the place is buzzing."
We are regular visitors of cinnamon grand specially noodles restaurant and came here again after the ugly incident and we fiound hotel security system was fantastic and they are very concern of the customers and not taking any risk now i can guarantee about their security arrangemnts
I visited Cinnamon Grand this evening & was amused to see the security measures taken by the hotel. The vehicles that entered were thoroughly checked. Even the bonnets of the vehicles were opened & checked. Do not worry about the safety. Do visit Chutneys for some authentic Indian food. Special thanks to Priyadarshana for his amazing service. Always with a smile & happy to serve. 
"We had a great time today,priyadarshana gave us an unexpected surprise for my bday,as usual his service was good.feels like home because of these guys every time we come here.and the ordered food was very nice."
"We came for a dinner with my family today,as usual we had a very good experience,and specially the staff is very friendly and helpful,and the food is delicious and worth for the price,mangala gayan   And eranga "
"Cinnamon has taken all rightful measures to assure the security of us as guests, foods in all their restaurents are exceptional as usual, nooodles is one our favourite restaurents with excellent service."
"We have enjoyed the food at cinamon and it was awesome.! Now the situation is back to normal and anyone can visit this place without any issue. ,Note - Place is well  secured and you can vist here without any hesitation.! You will be able experience taste food at cinamon at anytime.! ,We came out for dinner and had a good time at  noodles.! ,Thank you for the service.!"
"Walked into Cinnamon Grand a place so often visited with the girls,It was a delight to be greeted and made much of,Considering the unfortunate situation faced by them they carried themselves with so much strength in their hearts .,We had a delicious meal at The Noodle,Spoilt by Mangala, Gayan and Eranga. ,We know there is so much hope and prosperity here for all who work tirelessly to make every guest special"
We just visited cinnamon grand which I would call home away from home...was saddened by the fact that it was kind of empty..but the friendly welcome the staff with their smiling faces made us glad. Visited Noodle the staff the food and the welcome was so great..restaurant was kind of full was so happy to see it.. will visit as often as we could.thank you Mangala Eranga and Gayan for giving us excellent service smiling faces n good food
"Tonight we were at the Noodles Restaurant at Cinnamon Grand after the unfortunate incidents of the recent past. We experienced their resilient spirit.  It was as if we went home. We felt safe, enjoyed their excellent service and food dished out with that unmistakable smile,Cinnamon Brand has given us the best  hospitality can offer, at all times and been like our second home.  Now its time to stand by them and reciprocate their loyalty to us by patronizing their restaurants and rooms and help them in  their hour of need.,Dr. and Mrs. Anders Tunek"
"Today, me and my family had a peaceful and lovely dinner eve at Noodles as usual. Food was delicious and the services of Mr. Namal, Mr. Ranjith and their energetic team was superb. I would suggest the regular customers of Cinnamon Grand to continue with their usual meals."
"I stayed here for two nights in February. what a nice hotel!! The best thing of this hotel is the friendly staff. They always keeps you feeling you are valuable for them and the homely feeling. Rooms, nice luxury beds gives you a heavenly sleep. food is in excellent quality. keeps you out of the noises and rush, even in the middle of a busiest city centre."
"Colombo city has been through some tough time lately, but with tight security provided in the Hotels, it feels safe now to visit the places we loved visiting. ,Today we had a relaxing lunch out at Cheers Pub  one of the main restaurants in Cinnamon Grand Hotel. Food was excellent as always and the service couldn't have been any better. Madhura and the Cheers team, thank you!  It felt great to be back! "
Really happy to visit cinnamon after the attack and it was a superb evening at cinnamon grand hotel and hope and wish everything to be back to normal always happy to visit cinnamon .so sad to hear the lost of life's at cinnamon it will take some time to back to be normal stay strong and do not worry time will resolve all the issues..all the very best.
"Such a terrible thing to happen anywhere, but to such a wonderful hotel with the kindest most professional staff I have ever encountered. I stayed for two weeks last August  on business  where nothing was too much trouble. From my check - in with Leezza, who greeted me every time I saw her like a respected and cherished friend, who even arranged  picnic breakfasts for early starts to my day.To all the staff in every one of the restaurants, the housekeeping department, the Doormen and the Drivers, Thank You. My thoughts are with you and your families and I hope that you are all safe. Toni."
He has so nice and smile and shishe it was so nice service was very good   And my room was clean and comfortable l will visit again every things was awesome l love it thank you so much  Mr: priyadarshana️
i really enjoyed my time here at shisha bar ..the stuff priyadarshana is a reall great bartender ..he welcome us with his warm smile and great welcoming ever..best place for relaxing and good for family..the water melon fresh juice was awesome..
"Whilst the hotel is definitely luxurious, I can't get myself to give it more than a 3 for the following reasons:,1. Overpriced - our total nightly rate was extortionate purely because they charge more than 30% taxes on top of the rate,2. The electrical sockets aren't distributed properly in the rooms so to charge anything is also a nightmare ,3. We didn't feel like it was good value for money,Otherwise it's a great hotel but I just don't think it's worth what we spent on it."
The Food is Commendable to thr place and Music. Loved every Bit of IT. The Staff is verry friendly and thr service was fast and efficient. The Band is playing music according to thr Crowd. Would like to show our gratitude to Priyadarshana and the manager for the efforts taken to make our visit Great. Looking forward to see Cinnamon in the Future.
Hotel is well run and in an excellent location.  Facilities are excellent and the food is very good.  The staff are very helpful. The rooms are good size and there are enough outlets. Best rooms are overlooking the lake.
"Amazing Food ,Chef Piyal was did a wonderful job by recommending the type of cooking that goes with different type of sea food,Hashi and the staff did a wonderful job,Great stuff Lagoon,We would visit there again and each time we had visited the service quality was great "
"Shisha bar at cinnamon grand is a great place to catch up with your friends and I fully recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good time.  We were served by Pridarshana who was very polite and friendly and definitely we will be back..,"
"My family and I stayed at the Cinnamon Grand in Columbo last summer, July 2018. We traveled with our then 20 month old. All the staff at the hotel are wonderful. Special thanks to the staff in the business lounge who went above and beyond to make our stay fabulous! Particularly, Sanjeewa, Danushka, Shirath, who were so kind to our son and helped to make our stay so memorable! Thank you."
"I stayed recently for five nights on business. ,The location is great...one block from the water and close to the interesting Galle Park. ,Check in was very attentive. I was looked after by all manner of staff and worried that I was expected to be handing out tips (and had no Sri Lankan currency as yet). ,The public areas are pleasant, albeit fairly busy and often the seating areas were all occupied. It's also pretty brightly lit, seemingly day and night, although that is likely a personal taste thing. ,The room was large and well appointed. Everything was clean and everything I used was replaced the next day. There also was a turn down service. It was all most comfortable. ,The breakfast was very impressive. Lots of choice and all very pleasant, although always very busy when I was there. ,The executive floor was super with most excellent and attentive service. ,The pool area was good and the bar service there was of a high standard. Jackdaws were a bit of a problem, despite the staff's best efforts. ,I ate in a couple of the restaurants in the evenings and had good food and good service consistently."
"The food , staff, atmosphere was excellent!!!! Enjoyed being at the restaurant......,Although we are not fans of noodles much ........really enjoyed the food and the service.......loved the presentation of food as well.....thank you for  nirosh and Madura"
One of the best service i have experienced at the Coffee Stop.. despite the festive season and lack of staff in many hotels where serv9ce levels have dropped.. Welldone Dilshad keep up the great work. All the very best!
I visited Whisky lounge at cinnamon grand after long time! I must tell you it is awesome From the decor to the ambience is great! It also has Above all the prices of food and drink is great! I must make a special mention of the staff members who use to be there like Kapila now in room service whose service I miss. But not to mention Nishantha & Mahesh who gives a great service. I must mention these staff members Suren Sammuka Curator Mian and Madushanka as well as Dilushan at Coffee stop Keep it up your service is great
"Our 5 day stay here was excellent. The hotel is centrally located and the lobby area is great. Very clean and the staff attentive. It is however rumoured that this hotel has been sold and will be converted into a hospital. If this is true,its sad. We have stayed here on our 3 prior visits and would not stay anywhere else."
Staying at the Cinnamon Grand is wonderful but you can also just stop by  for a coffee and short  eat or a fabulous sweet treat while listening to the grand piano. It is a  very tranquil stop as you are sightseeing  down a Galle Road. They serve the best cappuccino in town and at a great price
"I am now at the hospitality lounge in the hotel.  Took a shower and wait for my midnight flight back home.  The lounge is clean, tidy and all necessities are available.   This arrangement is so thoughtful.  After a long hot day visit in Colombo, it feels so great to have a shower before the flight"
I visited cinnomon grand coffee stop with my family.

We had the most fantastic stay at the cinnamon grand. We wanted to thank all the staff for an amazing experience. In particular thank you to Mr Lakmal for making our stay truly special and Thiline for the amazing Omelettes each morning and for greeting us with a smile. 
I come here very frequently and always the service here has been extraordinary especially by Dilshan at Coffee Stop. He goes out his way to make your stop an enjoyable and a pleasant one. The food and drinks are always up to standard and more too.
One of the best places for a quick cup of coffee. The customer service of this place is top notch. Specially the barista called Dilshan. The cafe mocha is one one good cup of coffee along with a sandwich 
"Fabulous Food, I ordered filled chickens breast and it was great. The complementary bread with olive oil was the best thing. The hosts were very agile in service and didn’t shy from prompt orders. It was nice spending time here"
Our family lunch at noodles restaurant cinnamon grand was fantastic. The service led by Thushara Priyankara was superlative as usual and he really  makes us feel at home at noodles every time. The food once again was very rich and came in reasonably quick time. Definitely 9ne of my favourite restaurants 
"Good food, excellent service. Curator Pradeep did a wonderful job. The food was seasoned well and cooked brilliantly.,Thank you Echo.,A high price point but worth the experience.,The location is tucked in a cute area which is brilliant for a relaxing ambiance."
"We stayed at Cinnamon Grand for the first few nights of our two week stay in SL as well as our last two nights and it felt like home. ,The staff were very accommodating for whatever we asked for, the rooms very well equipped with comfortable airflow from the air con and we had no issue when we wanted to extend our stay.,The associated restaurants also provided a variety of cuisine which meant that there was always something different to eat. ,Highly recommended The Lagoon restaurant for fresh seafood! "
"Ambarella juice is a fabulous start before you dining! Only here served fresh! Food absolutely high end test of authentic Sri Lankan food. It is best of authentic environment, giving a feeling of tradition))"
"My first time visiting Cinnamon Grand. I have to say I really enjoyed the service the hotel provided. They will always go out of the way to satisfy the customer at no cost. I had a broken luggage which was fixed by the staff member. We requested a late check out at 4pm and was not charged. Good choices of restaurant and coffee shop., I would recommend Cinammond Grand to anyone and will stay here on my next visit.,Keep up the good job management team."
"If you are in doubt where to stay when in Colombo I assure you to choose this hotel. You have everything you need to fulfill your expectations. Above all what I love the most is helpful, attentive and smiling staff."
Great place to visit in Colombo if you are around. Met a great curator Pradeep who  is brilliant and took care of our orders all night. He knows  his stuff really well and provided us a great service. So as the rest of the crew. Really recommend this place if you are looking for great Italian food and drinks to go with it 
"Good service. Satisfied customer. Good atmosphere. Very clean. Food and drinks were good and shisha also good. Enjoyed well. Will come again for sure. ,Priyadarshana thanks for the good service keep it up."
The food were so tasty and the prizes were so reasonable at Cinnamon Noodles restaurant. Nice environment friendly waiters specially this Nirosh guy served us with nice manner. One of the best places to go.
Great atmosphere/ Great food. enjoyed a great meal. Service was excellent by priyadarshana. my favorite prawns was excellent too. it is a nice place to visit and experience the food. Thnx for every one working in cinnamon grand
We had the best service at the shisha bar. Priyadarshana did an amazing job ! We had a great time here and he made the time even better because his service was just great. The shisha was amazing and the cocktails were great too !
Very pleasant restaurant tonline in.very calm surrounding to have a quite meal  will visit again and recommend to many people  .food is good but the service stands ahead  .thanks Dilani for her recommendations
"The experience was good and we enjoyed it. We hope to come back for another meal in the future. The food was also good and good variety as well.,The ambiance was also great. The price was also reasonable."
Great atmosphere/ Great food. Family enjoyed a great meal. Service was excellent. The Thai Red fish curry was the best. Obviously my favorite prawns was excellent too. You pay premium price but it is a nice place to visit and experience the food.
"During the 3 weeks we travelled in Sri Lanka we spent 4 nights at this hotel at two different times. We initially chose it because of the opportunity to eat ""in-house"" at a large variety of restaurants/cafes without the need to venture out of the hotel. The hotel is what you would expect of a 5 star establishment re service, rooms etc but certainly the pool and restaurants we ate in were excellent. The buffet breakfast is something to behold - so many choices, go for the egg hoppers, yum - nothing wrong with a good dose of chilli to get the morning started! We had dinner twice at Lagoon, all about beautifully cooked very fresh seafood and once at Tao. I thought this was more of a Japanese cuisine but I'd describe it as general Asian - delicious and the outdoor setting was delightful. A great base while in Colombo."
"Had a delicious meal at Tao restaurant. Seats overlooking the water features and overall lovely ambience. Dilani who served us, gave a great recommendation on the food and was friendly and attentative throughout the meal. Highly recommend if visiting Colombo."
We had a wonderful meal in Chutneys restaurant. The food was superb and this was definitely enhanced by the friendly and helpful service of Sam (our waiter). He politely guided us through the menu and advised us which dishes may suit our taste. His suggestions were spot on and it was so good to try different curries too. If in doubt ...ask for Sam!
The food was really good. The service was amazing everyone is really helpful. Dhanaga and ruwan helped us a lot. The food is good everything was amazing we had a really good time in nugama hope to go there angain
I stayed there for three nights. Location is superb in the middle of the financial district of Colombo. I liked especially the proximity to a beautiful small lake. Great food at the Noodles restaurant.
"Loved the food, the atmosphere, and the service - definitely recommending the Thai red curry and the garlic chili chicken here! SO GOOD. Also, Hashi & Priyahkara was super helpful and wonderful throughout our meal. "
"Great service, and great shisha. Priyadarshana who served us was great and would highly recommend for anyone. The ambience was amazing and a great all round place to chill out. Best place in Colombo to sit down and have a shisha."
"I recommend this hotel in Colombo the staff are good also the room service is excellent especially the staff named Roshan he delivered my food in my room with a smile, he is Friendly and respectful, I hope they will hire more of the staff like Roshan... Keep it up Cinnamon Colombo"
"Excellent food n beverages with best of the service from the highly professional n friendly staff, visited with family n two friends from India who will definitely visit again. Thanks a lot.,Samitha Silva."
"very good shish , nice music , excellent service, our host name was Mr :   Priyadarshana he was the best one who prepares shisha  , i like it so  much, enjoy the stay in cinnamon grand hotel in colombo , i recommend it for everyone "
"The service here is awesome ,Cocktails are good,The sheesha is good and very smooth flavour,Food taste good,The sheesha falvours are made perfectly,The location is relaxing and carming, mr priyadarshana service is excellent"
Me and my boyfriend went there yesterday for dinner and it was really good! The food is amazing and also the service. Also finally a good wine in Sri Lanka. Especially our waiter Sam did a really good job! Would definitely come again and recommend it.
"The fundamental thing is missing - the safe is not securely mounted to anything and can be simply taken away, as good as no safe at all. Not deserving the ranking in my view unless the critical issues can be fixed."
"Great location for nice easy sunday. We had some drinks and food. Live was good. Priyadarshana served us and he was very pleasant, pliote and attentive to ensure our order was correct. Great personality, friendly... definitely visit this place again."
Best whisky lounge in colombo.all the staff who worked there were amazing. They look after me very well.curator sammuka  is one of the best server I ever met.they served me nice food. They have nice whisky cocktail also.keep it up the good work 
"As always I enjoyed staying at this hotel.  Conveniently located for business travelers.  The hotel is very lively and has several options to dine. The room is spacious and clean. The only problem this time I found is though the room was non smoking,  the smell was there in the room and also on the corridor.  Hope they do something about it because as a non-smoker, I found the smell not very pleasant. Other than that I would rate this hotel very high. "
"Charming resturant never to miss . Very calming environment to chill out with nice beer. Hidden place in the city but well recognized I guess. Food is ok but the service is comparely outstanding. Dilani was very knowledgeable,and should thankher for welcoming service"
"Perfect food and service! Traditional Sri Lanka food! Love the restaurant. Nice entertainment, love music and traditional dance performance and! fire man!!! My dad wanted noodles, they brought him noodles from there noodles restaurant! Will definetely come back!"
We had a great meal at Tao. The crispy duck was fantastic and our server Dilani was even better. She was knowladgeable and really interesting to talk to. She even gave our daughter some fish food to feed the fish in the pond. Thanks for a nice meal!
"I had a great stay a cinnamon grand.hotel is really nice people are always helpful,For dinner I went to Lagoon Hashi spoke to me.she asked from me about the feedback I can give   marks.can recommend this restaurant.she gave good service during the lunch time also wen I come to Lagoon .,Food is excellent thank you Lagoon giving me a delicious meal during my stay."
"Warm and friendly Welcome, and staff recommended few dishes and the suggested dishes were super good too!,Enjoyed the food, hospitality and the atmospheres. Staff is really friendly and cool. Looking forward coming here again!"
"Always known for some of the best cakes in the city, did a delightful surprise in making a custom birthday cake. Almost limitlessly accommodating Chef. ARUNA with his amazing insight & attention to detail made a unique five-layered french cake with each layer representing an exotic flavor, finished off with a flowery tropical outlook. Surprisingly affordable overall, contrary to popular belief. ,  Coffee shop Ship-leader DIAN with his warm & enthusiastic willingness to 'walk-that-extra-mile' to find the best professionals for the project made all the difference.  If you'll ever happen to be at the 'Coffee Stop' for a such a need, look for DIAN & Chef ARUNA. You'll never be disappointed.  ,-Dr. Rajitha"
"Of all the hotels I have gone to this has been the only place where the front desk staff had no idea about their hotel. One of your staff members ""Thamara"" had no idea which direction I had to take in order for me to go to my room. I had to wait for 15 minutes with my heavy back pack until she finally showed me the way which was already too late for her because I asked one of the bus boys. I gave her another chance and asked where Taprobane was. All she gave me was a blank face which clearly explained that either she had no idea what language I was speaking or again she had no idea how I should go there. I was told that cinnamon grand hotel had an impeccable staff who knew what information they have to give from A to Z but clearly this shows that this fact is false! Time wasting and blank faces don't help a hotel especially a hotel such as yours. I hope that you don't allow this time wasting experience to repeat itself once again to another visitor."
"I stayed here for one night during a business trip.  I use a wheelchair but found moving around all areas of the hotel easy.  The staff are very polite, friendly and helpful.  Special thanks to the lobby manager Brian Regginalld."
"Very very nice atmosphere and nice employees specially on breeze bar very nice welcoming I like the service there it S amazing I advice everyone to go there and try the cocktails ,special thanks to Fahd he is so friendly and professional I like his service he is a nice guy "
Great food for such a great price! awesome service. we were lucky enough to get a great waiter in Nilupul who kept us entertained right through the night and was a part of the awesome service. Great experience as a whole!
It was nice service by her impressed tomvisit agin. Nice service plus the nice food. Should try this we will surely come again. Nice try. The best chinese resturant must be. Thank for her service. Thanks
"I continue to come back to this hotel because it is stylish, well located, with great service and a feeling of luxury. The Taprobane restaurant has been updated and the breakfast buffet is great. An egg hopper in the morning is a great way to start the Sri Lankan day. ,The lobby is elegant and sophisticated. People keep stopping by the beautiful fountain in the center to take selfies. The piano music really makes the place feel like a central meeting place. ,Between my work meetings i had a few hours each day to grab a coffee in the lobby coffee shop. It is a place to watch Colombo's beautiful people as they sip their drinks in the glow of the evening sun shining through the skylight. Every day, I was welcomed by Mr. Malith and Mr. Nilupul who asked ""How was your day?"" and ""Today, you should treat yourself!"" Friendly and effective salesmen, and perfect hosts! This is why I come back to the Cinnamon Grand each time!  ,The rooms are great and comfortable. But this time I spent more time by the pool to enjoy the warm air and the cool water. Too bad work gets in the way!"
Had a very stressfulday & came for a dinner to Tao Chineese Restaurant. Saw very friendly person Mr. Priyadarshana at Cinnamon Grand Shisha bar & he served a very quality & fantastic shisha & made my weekend night awesome. Would really recommend for all my forign & local friends to visit Cinnamon Grand for there stay as well as to try best shisha in heart of colombo from Priyadarshana in Cinnamon Grand shisha lounge. 
"Cinnamon Grand was our first stop in a two week tour of Srilanka. After a long flight from Australia (several hour delay in Singapore) our check-in was seamless and the room delightful. The nightly turndown service was greatly appreciated, especially the touch of tea and chocolates. The food at breakfast was delicious, but as we were in Colombo for only one day we didn’t sample any of the hotel’s tempting restaurants. Only regret is that we hadn’t booked any other Cinnamon hotel during our trip. We would definitely recommend this hotel."
"I have been coming to this hotel for many years and everything from the staff, management and cuisine is amazing. The staff are humble and friendly always greeting you with a huge Sri Lankan smile!,The fantastic array and variety of exotic food produced by chefs here leave Michelin star chefs in Europe way way behind.,Well done and Thank YOU."
"Great food , great atmosphere staffs are friendly and it felt like we are at real village,  Thanks again and will visit again , with great company from hsbc Colombo ,Todays crew :,Ruwan,  Dananajaya , Vasalage,Ishara"
Nice place great service with MR priyadarshana I love coming here and the do it professionally I highly recommend it thank you so much for this amazing service I would come again and again for this place 
"Good service from Breeze Bar sheesha lounge. Priyadarshana was serving us, nice guy. Good music and vibes. Good place to hangout always.,The swimming pool around and the outdoor ambience is perfect. Thumbs up! Keep it up!"
"Wonderful downtown hotel, near beach, shopping and other upscale hotels. Unfortunately, our flight left just after midnight so we did not sleep over, We had a lovely buffet dinner though I do not think it was in the main restaurant. It was Sat night with lots of wedding festivities. I did walk around and saw several other restaurants on the property."
"Excellent service. Friendly staff. (Priyadarshana is very friendly and quick in service),Also great food & great ambience with good live music. Specially the hot butter mushroom is very tasty!,Thank you!"
"This was our first visit to majestic Srilanka.Way back from Nuwara Eliya ,we reached Colombo on 26 th Oct.What a city!Everything was so perfect,everywhere ,we were cordially greeted.We enjoyed every moment .People are so good,within few hours we had a good number of friends.On the 27 th oct we decided to have our lunch at Cinnamon Grand,what a place,so beautiful ,all the members gave us a very  warm reception ,great ambience.We were really delighted .I must mention the name of my new Srilankan friend,my brother ,Darshana (who was attending us during our lunch)at Taprobane Restaurant (we had lunch over there).Darshana is an extremely well mannered ,courteous ,lovable person.We were simply spell bound with his hospitality,he made us so so happy,he went beyond our expectations ,serving lot of things one after another as complimentary ,as a token of love.I must say ,he is an asset of any restaurant or any organisation .Till date we are in touch through What’s app.After few months of our visit to beautiful Srilanka,I am writing this review as token of love and gratitude for my brother Darshana.May God bless him with all sorts of happiness and success.What a great variety of delicious delicacies we had,simply awesome.Darshana made it possible ,a life time memory to relish.Love you Srilanka .Hope to visit again.,Goutam Chatterjee,Psychologist,Kolkata,Jadavpur ,India ."
"The Taprobane Restaurant in this hotel  ivokes many fond  memories of good food  to many people.,To cap it all today,two Sous Chefs, Asanka and Costa spoke to me about my thoughts ,on the quality and taste of the food served,and my ideas on improvements,and suggestions on what should be prepaired.,To find this level of involvement with the customer is  taking service to a new,height!,No wonder friends of mine from UK and Australia come all the way just to eat the excellent breakfasts and meals served at the Taprobane that brings back memories of past times, when this sort of food was only served in homes by their mums!!!.,Good wishes to you all at the Taprobane, and Manager Udaya...striving hard to improve standards and quality when all about you, in other places, are falling by the wayside!,Russell."
"Excellent service at ECO Italian restaurant , The good was amazing and friendly atmosphere with a welcoming attitude. ,Order the modha fish which was very good.,Curator Pradeep was excellent and always with a friendly attitude. ,I recommend this place to anyone for a good meal and chat., "
"The staff was very good and they were friendly with us specially Thisara , good food , nice place and laksa lemak was really delicious i would like to try it again very soon and i would recommend anyone to try it"
"We are appreciate Mr/ priyadarshana in shisha section. At swimming pool side .he did very nice service at the end of his duty and also has a nice smile..... we are always visited the cinnamon hotel and he always in the same appearance and he so helpful all the time .....,Best regards: Eman nasr , Doaa nasr,Thank you .. we are so happy and we just send this appreciate letter to explain that point to the manger cinnamon hoter ...,Thanks a lot..."
"Myself and three of my friends visited Coffee Stop at cinnamongrand. I ordered mutton roll and ice coffee dats my favorite. My friends ordered some sandwiches and frappes all top notch. Service was friendly,fast and efficient . Special thanks to Sanjeewa, Nilupul , udhagaran and Mr.Delucian always very vigilant and attentive. Always best place for coffee"
"Stayed at the hotel on 5th January 2019 with family. Nice hotel, quite big, very croweded. The loby actually resembles a nicely decorated public place :-) Good location, but not on the sea. Rooms are small (  common for all city based hotels ), but nicely decorated and maintained. Didn't had any food at the hotel as there are so many eating joints nearby like Ministrty of Crab etc. and so can not comment on the restaurants. The banquet is at the middle under a dome and the floors are on a circular formation keeping the banquet at the centre. So you get a good view of people dancing and performing from above as if you are seeing it from a gallery :-)) ,Good experience alltogether."
"We had a short stop over in Colombo, and chose nice hotel finalize the great holiday. The hotel was really nice and beautiful, staff was really nice and helpful, altough we had our tourist clothes on, last clean ones (most visitors wore suit :D ),The italian restaurant was really good and the service spectacular, food exellent.,Only thing to comlain was the upstair pool area, which is quite outdated, and the jacuzzi is couple bubbles from the wall. ,Would visit again, maybe couple night next time to just enjoy the facilities"
This is my 3rd time at Cinnamon Grand Colombo. Outstanding property in the heart of Colombo. Breakfast and food is superb. Only 5 minutes walk from sea and 15 minutes from Marine Drive (for more Sri Lankan Food Options).
"I recommend this shisha bar i like the service of Priyadarshana and the other crew alao  they are very helpful and kind thank you so much , the taste of shisha , atmosphere and the view of relaxing pool"
Best place to have a true Sri lankan meal ..the minute you walk in the place it changes everything...you walk in to an era of 1940 or before that .. if you want that experience this is the place .. don't forget ginger tea ...
"Shisha bar is a amazing place to have a shisha. We had some food and mocktails. It was amazing. Priyadarshana,Fahad and manager Upali. They are awesome. Nice atmosphere. Highly recommended this place. We are coming again and again because of priyadarshana and fahad."
Nugagama had an authentic village feel in the middle of the city. Every detail was considered down to the napkins. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Monday’s are extra special as there are traditional dancers and musical performances.
"We had a great time at the shisha bar , service was excellent and staff were friendly and helpful and amazing ,, shisha and tea were nice,,special thanks to Mr priyadarhana who was super nice with a lovely smile at all time ,, thank you again"
"Very nice hotel. The rooms are bid and airy. Food was very good and a varied variety. We had a room that overlooked a park where they were holding a contest, but it finished at 11pm and was not an issue. Even the air con which was on all night was fairly quiet"
"We came for dinner to Chutneys during our honeymoon. Our waiter Sam was kind, efficient & helpful. He helped us decide what to order, we told him the flavours and spices we liked and he made excellent recommendations. He came to check throughout our meal if we were happy.,Best Indian food we have had. Would recommend! Thanks Sam!"
"Nice and clean hotel the food is really nice ,Special thanks to Mr SAMAN from room service for the good hospitality and his behavior ,Try lagoon restaurant as well one of the best seafood restaurant ,Samar Hassan ,Room number 419,15/3/2019"
"Very good ambience and great SriLankan cuisine.   Great service from Mangala, Eesara, Krismal and Nisal & team. Overall a great experience.   Amazing dance and lively music.  A must visit for families with children"
"We had the most relax time by the pool - at the breeze bar.,Our server Priyadarshana was amazing. He recommended some awesome cocktails which was just out of this world. Awesome attitude and customer service. Wish there were more servers like him..."
"All the staff at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel are extremely friendly from the doormen to the managers.,They set the bar in hospitality when it comes to delicious food from many cuisines and customer relations.,One of the friendly staff at The Coffee Stop:"
Excellent ambience and staff the food is great. Helpful and friendly service. I would recommend my friends to visit the Restuarant. The sports bar is great. You can sit and have a drink and watch cricket and soccer
"Superb hotel situated heart of Colombo close to all amenities. Spacious, clean and luxurious rooms with modern comforts. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Best thing is the number of restaurants it has. You have a range of cuisine options from Sri Lankan to sea food to international. I tried Nuga gama the traditional Sri Lankan restaurant and Lagoon seafood restaurant which were awesome with heaps of options. Extremely satisfied with the stay. Highly recommend !"
I gotta say that cheers pub is my favorite bar in colombo. It's perfect for any occasion. The staff is very friendly and helpful . I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The bartenders here make some of the best cocktails so try it out 
"Nasitha and dilani were very good. The place serves excellent Chinese food. Enjoyed the hospitality.,Keep it up ,Good work guys we will be definitely visiting again  .nice food to taste and the atmosphere is fantastic"
"Had a great night. Food here is fabulous and the setting is very inviting. Mangala, Wasalage, Ishara and Krishmal takes very good care of you. There's a live traditional band playing most of the days."
"Dilani is an excellent host. She is warm , friendly and courteous. Being multi-lingual she reaches out to your diverse clientele with ease . Good staff is difficult to get. Hold on to her like gold dust."
"While the atrium wing which houses the hotel rooms is strangely dark (for an atrium), the rooms are bright, very well appointed and impressively clean. The pool area is quite nice too and the pool bar is a lovely and breezy indoor/outdoor bar. However, service there was a bit slow and I received possibly the worst burger I've had in years. (But, hey, that's what I get for ordering a burger in Sri Lanka in the first place, I know, I know.)"
The service provided by Mr. Roshan and Mr. Nuwan is simply amazing with smile on their face and providing exactly what I was looking for .. they are the best staff I have ever been served by . Love the services 
This is a good place. Very calm and beautiful. Good hospitality. Thanks for the team. Mangala ishara dannajaya make my dinner desseves special thanks for මංගල ta.we came for two time we will back again .
"It's a graet place and food fantastic. Kids have a lot to play with. The supporting staff also very good. ,Ruwan And Dhananjaya and krusmal and wasalage did a very supporting and friendly service.,thanks a lot"
"Stayed for 2 nights. Great service at check-in and checkout. A range of restaurants ,nuga guma was a great experience and the staff were very efficient and friendly. Recommended! Great clean rooms and plenty of in-room amenties. The food at the wedding was also delicious."
"We were guests at the hotel for 3 nights.  Of the 7 hotels we stayed in during our 3 weeks in Sri Lanka, this was indeed the most grand.,Check-in was very good and the multiple staff welcoming us very cordial.,We were located in the older wing of the hotel, which we were advised was once a Taj property.  It was understated but immaculately clean. That end of the property is extremely quiet. In fact, as one walks the corridors, it appears deserted. ,Our only complaint with the room is that the selection of English channels was limited compared to some other hotels where we stayed. ,Our included breakfast at the Taprobane was most disappointing. I will review that later. We also ate at Noodles (to be reviewed), Nuga Gama (reviewed) and spent many hours in the tea lounge (to be reviewed.),The hotel's location is ideal. ,Check-out was exemplary and our bill was in order."
"We came to this restaurant two times.,The buffet was amazing.,Autentic and a big selection of Sri Lankan food.,The waiter Wasalage and Dhananjaya are very courteous and nice guys. ,Also the manager Ruwan is amazing and we talked with them about the country.,In our oppinion the best restaurant in Colombo."
Try to find Saldin and Stanislaus as they will assist you with what you need at the lounge. Very good service and very accomodating. Did not encounter any issues during my stay at the lounge... The foods were OK...
"Excellent hotel. Highly recommended hotel in Sri Lanka. Lounge is very nice, very professional staff and crew. Food is excellent, too. Very hospitable personnel. I will definitelt come back in this hotel. Curator stanislaus and saldin . Thank you very much!!!! See you again!"
"From the moment one is welcomed by the doorman one feels at home . Although a large hotel , the staff soon make you feel like an honoured guest . From the smiling staff at the superb breakfast buffet, to each of the 14 restaurants, one is welcomed by smiling faces . The reception desk is staffed by those who speak fluent English, and Amanda checked me in , and each day was very helpful in making arrangements for me . The Concierge Chandimal saw to it that my iPad was recharged through the night and ready for collection first thing in the morning. My bedroom was well furnished , beautifully clean , and I liked the fact that chocolates are left every evening on the coffee table ."
"5 star hotel, but not a 5 star experience. At arrival all was good, but after check in, things was not what we hoped for. The breakfast was total caos. The staff was running, the tables did not get cleaned, there where no glasses when we went to get drinks, we had to ask and look around for staff to bring coffee. The breaksfast area was all to small for this hotel and we felt that the hole breakfast was stressfull. We where really looking forward to a nice 5 star breakfast. The rooms was ok, we had a premium room. The rooms are getting a little old, but the bed was really good and the housekeeping looks after you. Nice pool area as well. To sum it up, we felt that it not was worth 5 stars, but still a good and really big hotel with many restaurants to choose from."
"We selected Taprobane Restaurant when my wife and I hosted our good friend from the University of Bath of UK, when he visited our Department of Civil Engineering of University of Moratuwa as the external examiner.  We were there for dinner and the variety of food available was amazing and it included all kinds of Eastern, Japanese, Western, etc.  It was all wonderful food with no limit, but all at a fixed price of less than US $ 20 per person.  We enjoyed it all very much and the variety of desserts was also wonderful.   I am sure this is one of the best restaurants in Colombo for any visitor looking for a very good meal after a full day of sight seeing."
"One of the best ambiances I have seen , most friendly staff and food .... out of this world. Real taste of Lanka. Mangala , Ruwan , Isara , Dananjaya well done and keep up the good work. ,Not forgetting lovely live music. I would come back for sure and must bring my friends along "
"Had a comfortable and pleasant stay at the hotel. Hotel was excellent with outstanding facilities, very centrally situated. Nilantha, Sajeeva, Upul, ladies at the desk and Dashendra at the restaurant provided us with excellent service."
"Recently I stayed at Cinnamon Grand hotel, Colombo for two nights on a business trip. Location was very central. Felt like hotel has not changed for quite some time. ,Staff is very friendly, however could do with bit more attention to guests specially during brakefast buffet and at the Cheers Pub.,Facilities are grate at the hotel, got so many restaurants, swimming pool, ect. "
"From the time  Cinnamon Grand opened in 1975 (then the Hotel Lanka Oberoi) this has been the best Hotel in Colombo. After it became Cinnamon Grand the place reflects warmth, a nice place for get togethers, family reunions or just chilling! It also has everything needed for guests in close proximity with the Crestcat Mall on the same premises. I highly recommend the Cinnamon Grand Hotel."
This is one of the best places to hang out. Shisha bar is awesome if you wanna hang out and chill with your buddies on a weekend. The atmosphere is serene and cozy with warm music that will set the mood for a great evening. Definite try out spot. Highly recommend Priyadarshana’s warm hospitality.
"We arrived and were told we'd been upgraded to a superior room. If that's the case I'd hate to stay in a standard room. It was small, tired and the bathroom needed a complete refit. Overall the hotel is noisy, impersonal and more sutiable for business/weddings. The pool is small. Staff very helpful. I remember this hotel when it was the Oberoi and THE place to stay in Colombo... today it is a far cry from its heyday.,Cheers pub in the basement was dire. The main area that represents an ""authentic English pub"" is given over to the smoking area so those who do not smoke are seated in what is effectively a corridor and an ante-room - and the smoke is all pervading. Staff great, food poor."
"We came from Saudi for a five day break and found the hotel stunning. We have written the restaurant reviews separately but overall the food was excellent. We recommend that you book in the renovated part of the hotel as the bathroom has higher pedestals (my wife has a titanium knee) and the hotel were able to move us-thank you. ,We had a great trip with the Cinnamon Ranger, Nishantha, to the Elephant Orphanage, Botanic Gardens and Temple of the Tooth (separate reviews) and would recommend him for a day out.,There was a huge variety of live music and easy access through an adjacent mall to reasonably priced tuk-tuks. We also had a pool day and overall had a really enjoyable stay."
"We stayed here two nights. Good sized standard room, clean and well appointed. Free bottled water and a wide selection of amenities in the room. Lovely pool. Large breakfast buffet. Some of the reception staff were a little in under trained, for example not knowing where the hotel was on one of their local area maps. Otherwise good."
I wanted to have really nice Peking duck in Colombo but wasnt sure if they sure authentic ones. But have to admit Tao Resturant made my expectation true. Dilani suggested go with skin as starters and try the meat as suzzliling duck dish.
The hotel was great. I went for an event which we hosted in a restaurant there. The Food was awesome. We had a great spread of seafood delicacies. Even the deserts were yummy. The event was based on a Single malt and Cigar evening. The bar where we held the event had great service and served the guests very well.
"We had our executive board meeting in Angsana and it was a great experience. The team at the banquets Mahesh, Chathuranga & Karen were very supportive and helpful. They were available throughout the meeting and it was easy to reach out to them. Very friendly and active staff. Thank you guys. You made the day very pleasant. Keep up the good work."
"Ive been here many times ,I love the atmosphère and the shisha, the food je also great and they have LIVE BAR BANDS NIGHTS also the  staff are so amazing and friendly specially my friand Priyadarshana look for him he is the BEST"
"Very nice environment, peaceful and enjoyable. Also food are fabulous specially mutton and crab curry and very happy with service provided by staff. Also chef personally attended for our additional food requirement"
"Large and impersonal, on a very busy road and appended by a large an uninspiring shopping mall, this is not a place I would recommend as a great holiday experience/destination. That said, as a stopover for one night before travelling on, the room was large and comfortable and made for a good rest. "
"My family and I enjoyed our stay at Grand Cinnamon. The hotel caters for all from authentic Srilankan cuisine to the best coffee shop with a wide variety of snacks and homemade cakes! The décor and ambience at the Jaffna festival was amazing and something I highly recommend to experience as it has native dances and food- takes place in February every year. The lagoon seafood restaurant is a must try, we really enjoyed the spices used to prepare the aromatic and tasty food!,We initially has issues with our booking, no fault of the hotel, but the hotel manager and staff took it upon themselves to resolve the issue swiftly. Special thank you to Yasangika Samaranayake for following up with the booking issue and making our stay at the hotel comfortable."
"Very satisfied dinner in this restaurant. ,Servers kinded, dish was perfect. ,My father said it was verrrry good. Soo satisfying food and welcoming hospitality. Happy to come in our next visit in srilanka."
"The best food festival ,ambience and activity happens here are very special, the staffs are good and Mr  Stanislaus is fabulous , dancers are really excellent ,foods are must tasteable and specifically I prefe tamarine  juice are the best "
"Great hotel very central and fantastic selection of restaurants.  ,Breakfast is a bit of a free for all and good luck getting a table that has been cleared and coffee for that matter.,Car service excellent always very prompt and helpful ,Rooms and hotel looking a little tired now but generally excellent service from staff and wonderful restaurants make up for it"
Breeze bar is fantastic place to visit with friends and chill out. Got a great service from Priyadarshana. We had mocktais and french fries. Food is amazing and reasonable. I highly Recommend to people who like to relax.
"Came here for business and staying at this property for the first time and one word. WOW.  ,From checking in to my room, seamless. The car picked me up at the airport and delivered me to the front door, where I was whisked to my room with amazing amenities and the best bed ever. ,Then to the executive lounge the service, food and beverages are awesome. And the staff best trained and polite that I have ever met. ,From Cheers Bar and Restaurant to the other 13 restaurants outstanding service. ,Even my butler who personally asked if I had laundry it is a joy. ,I was taken to a Jaffna food festival in the garden that transported you to a real village with singing, dancing and fabulous local food. ,So if you are in the region or the Maldives please consider the Cinnamon Group of hotels and resorts for an experience you will never ever forget. ,10 stars for the Cinnamon Group out of 5. Please develop more hotels. "
"We had lunch dinner at Taprobane many times.. The servers here are extremely friendly and helpful. Food was Delicious, fresh and properly prepared  with many virieties.. We enjoyed a lot..Thanks to Cinnamon grand..."
"Good food,good customer servise, good enviroment , good staff stanislaus disheera kumar shanker vinoth. Keep up the good work cinnomon grand. Love y’all ,  i hope you organise more events like this  hope to see you soon"
"Extremely friendly, very helpful and  always approaches with a big smile!!! Her personal dish suggestions are spot on. Thank you Dilani for making our dinner an extra special one. Looking forward to coming again soon. :)"
"Thank you so much your loving & best service . Happy moments ,Fantastic dancing ,music and entertainers , Delicious special dinner . Thanx a lot Mr.Ruwan,Mr.Fahad ,Mr.Herby & all staf members . Good job."
"Nothing grand about this hotel at all. This hotel is old and has probably seen better days. Quite disappointing given its TripAdvisor ranking. I'm guessing the ranking was built up back in the day when there was far less competition, but there are much better and more modern options now for the same price."
No wonder this is rated as the best Chinese resturant in Colombo. Food is average yet the service is very satisfying. Can expect us visiting here again.. Delani was superb in her nice service. It was grear
"I had visited Tao for my anniversary. My spouse being a vegetarian had great options to choose from and the food was delicious. They took extra care to make sure that she was served properly as per her dietary requirements. ,I had some dim sums, duck and pork and they were all excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."
We are enjoying jaffna festival at cinnamon grand . Absolutely all was fantastic. Food was delicious. This our 1 at time to cinnamon Grand. Ruwan and fahad they are awesome very friendly. Also thanks to herby and namal
"We had a great time at jaffna festival and Malinda gave a great a service (very attentive, hospitable and friendly). The food was amazing and the atmosphere was beautiful! We are looking forward for next year (with more desserts please)"
"I really wanna to thankful all the staff special the shisha bar man  priyadarshana,For his hospitality and his service really he was very fast and we was more than satisfied   And inshalah we  will back there soon "
"We decided to spend a few hours at the cinnamon grand and have some drinks and lunch, we then decided that we would have a dip in the pool as it was quite hot and we ended up having lots of cocktails before and after lunch. Extremely dissapointed that we were charged RP 2500 ( approx $20AUD) per person for a quick dip ( was super quick as although the water looked inviting it was absolutely freezing so we would have been in the pool for a maximum of 10mins) we did tell the staff memeber we were just checking to see if the water was warm and was told that no we had to pay first before we could dip our feet in. Happy to pay to use the pool as we did this at many of the resorts in srilanka but have never been charged more than about $8AUD! I think this was an absolute rip off, given that we spent over $900AUD for lunch and drinks for our party of 8."
We have been coming here all the time.they give us high quality service.and also classy service they give I’m happy all the time to dine here specially I need to mention Hashi giving great service assisting me with a smile and also lolita eranga and channa giving me a quality service 
Very pleased to visit Tao resturant and it has its unique pleasant way to attract customers. Specially to mention Dilani provided such a remarkable service to admire. Food is beyond expectation. Really happy
"My group and I all had a collectively fantastic experience at the hotel! All of the staff are excellent, anticipate your needs and generally offer a very high level of customer service. We organised a conference for about 50 people at the hotel and the function went seamlessly- the events team were great and always on call for our requests, even late night. Planning the event was also very easy for us and there was support during our entire event- we never had to look for staff. Every request, no matter how strange it was was met. ,The rooms are clean, comfortable and luxurious. Housekeeping was also cheerful and great!. Hotel food was also great. All in all, we went on a work trip but felt like a holiday between the spa, pool and service! I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for both the work and leisure traveller. Its also well located and you can walk to some of Colombo's best sites!  Service at its BEST!"
We enjoyed the Jaffna food in Cinnamon Grand. Food was amazing. Live tamil band . Ruwan and fahad they are very helpful highly  Recommend This place to everyone. I surely come back with my family.......
"The food is so delicious.. experienced the real jaffna flavor. Nice festival I have never seen this much of dishes and dancers .. service was good ,Stanislaus and anoj look after very well ,We will come back again "
"The hotel is good, but what I like the most of all - their stuff: always polite, helpful, honest and somehow they know what you need. ,I had a wonderful time at their Shisha bar (one of the best shisha I ever tried!) Want to thank Priyadarshana for his attending!  5 stars without any hesitations keep it up "
"Lovely food, with lots of local food, was all very tasty. Service was excellent, our waiter was a mam called meninda, and he was very helpful. Would highly recommend this place. Reasonably priced for the quality of food as well"
"The experience was great. Highly recommend can’t believe it’s in the middle of Colombo...,The guys Kumar and stanislaus are amazing..,Excellent service the staff are very courteous and friendly..,The food is exquisite proper jaffna food cooked in clay pots with jaffna spices. The ambiance is great as well . Definitely gonna come back again ,Thanks stanislaus and Kumar "
"Tried Tao resturent for the first time and really happy with the standard , food taste and service. Atmosphere was fantastic. They had a good variety. Staff was friendly and Dilani gave a good service ."
"Excellent food and good entertaining events with traditional jaffana culture ,and nice hospitality with Nirosh and Prabus. That was our first experience in jaffna festival in cinnomon since i was awaiting to have delicious Tamil food.so it was a good opportunity for us."
A very exciting event. Excellent food and outstanding cultural programme. Excellent service rendered by Prabu. NirishSuperb Room Service. Keep up the high standard. Thanks. Outstanding hotel and facilities.
"We have just returned from a 3 day 2 night trip organised by Cinnamon Nature Trails staying at Habarana Lodge, Habarana which we booked in Columbo whilst staying at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel. ,Our guide for the three days, Nishantha suggested an itinerary which included Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, cultural sites in Kandy, Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa, and a elephant Safari in the wild. During our wonderful time with him he was flexible to our wishes and recognised what was best for us. He gave us his knowledge and advice willingly without being pushy. Nishantha’s knowledge of the wildlife was incredible, he helped two people not familiar with birds spot a Serpent Eagle from 100yds. He was also keen to help us in our understanding of the welfare of the animals. ,Thank you Nishantha! "
The best service in colombo ihave seen  .he was so energetic and very keen on his service.these kind of hardworking people should get appreciated.we will defineatly bevisiting.thanks nasitha for your service

"Excellent ambiance and food. The service is very friendly. Worth a visit. Stanislaus , namal , shanker. It’s great to see the cultural aspects of Jaffna. Fully worth the money  make sure you try the Palmyrah toddy  "
"Last year, within 24 hours of arriving in Sri Lanka, I found myself in the hospital needing emergency surgery.  The staff at the Cinnamon Grand took care of me to a level I would never have imagined.  A few weeks ago, I returned for the first time since that trip, and I have to say the experience of the hotel and the kindness of the staff did not disappoint at all.  Jeremy, the concierge who had taken me to the hospital last year and did the paperwork for me while I waited for the doctor, called me shortly after I got to my room last month just to welcome me to the hotel.  It was his birthday but he made a point to make sure I was comfortable and satisfied.  The next day, I got to meet his family and thank him in person.  I also received a welcome call from Nilantha, the other concierge who had looked after me last year on my second trip to the hospital.  He, like Jeremy, went out of his way to make sure I enjoyed my stay.  I spend several hundred nights a year in hotels, but no hotel has captured my heart the way the Cinnamon Grand has -- it simply has everything -- rooms, restaurants, facilities, and staff -- at the highest level.  The service, though, stands out to me as being truly exceptional."
Very good setup and Lovely food. Well organized by the hotel staff. Enjoyed the Jaffna culture dance. Jaffna Toddy was the best. I recommend this for anyone who like Jaffna food. Mangala is selling the best Jaffna attack.  We can purchase bottles and take to our country back
"Had dinner with the family at the Jaffna festival that was held at the Nuga sevena that day ,And decided to have coffee and a some snacks at the lobby bar.The staff on duty was the least helpful staff we had ever met at cinnamon Grand .The new rule that no food will be served after midnight at the lobby bar gives late night customers no reason to visit the hotel at all considering the fact that even the staff are not too keen to serve or help in anyway."
"I’m a regular visitor to Colombo and wouldn’t stay anywhere else. There’s been a lot of new 5-star options arrive in the market in the past few years and I’ve sampled a few, but for service and friendliness remain miles off the cg. I stay on the exec floor and it’s always worth it; the friendliness and care extended to me is unsurpassed anywhere else I’ve stayed in the world. Congratulations guys - can i especially mention the exec floor staff at desk, butlers and lounge staff; all remarkable. Thankyou - Carl"
"We had a wonderful and patient cinnamon ranger , Nishantha who not only showed us the sites in the city , brought us to to have the one of the most authentic Sri Lankan lunch and not to mention the best pineapple gateau in the city .It was a wonderful experience .Thank you .."
"Reception was excellent & although checkout is normally 12midday, we were allowed to stay till 6pm at no extra charge. if we wanted a longer stay(till 8pm) half room rate would apply. Food was good, rooms were clean & comfortable."
Had a fabulous time at this incredible resort. Get to the Breeze Bar - great music and ambiance. Special mention to Bala and Tuan for their hospitality!! A fabulous resort and I definitely recommend it to anyone travelling through colombo!
we went to the cinnamon grand hotel for two days during dilmah event over all it was very nice hotel at the middle of the city and friendly service special thanks to Mario who give me big assist and always smiling 
"i had thr pleasure to visit the Jafna food festival at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel with friends, one of whom was a Jafna native. From whrn ee walked in we wrre treated really well. Thr fouod.was outstsnding. With a great.diversityof itms and spice.,Pic with stanislaus great hospitality"
"Rested two nights at Cinnamon Grand, clean and spacious room although a little old. Well equipped amenities. Dedicated, friendly and polite staff. Check-in was smooth and efficient. Beautiful infrastructure. "
We stayed here for two nights at the start of our Sri Lankan holiday. Very central location for sight seeing (about 45 mins from the airport). The pool area was lovely for an afternoon swim and we had a fabulous foot massage at the mall connected to the hotel (lucky it was connected as there was a huge downpour that afternoon). Also at the mall were ATM’s and a supermarket. The rooms were interconnected and beautifully appointed with everything our family of 4 needed. Staff were friendly and helpful and we had a fabulous dinner at Tao restaurant and enjoyed the breakfast buffet. Would definitely stay again. 
Very energetic place. Awesome food and service. Enjoyed the sushi . Kudos to the team in front desk and the service staff. Sir some srilankan sweets to taste. Overall beautiful experience. Thank you so much. 
"Lovely hotel with white glove service and well appointed rooms featuring good views, quiet environment, in room WiFi, large closet, safe, turn down service and bathroom with tub and separate shower. This is definitely a convention hotel as it is enormous but the tower is quiet and the staff very friendly and accommodating. Dinner buffet was over the top with food stations from every part of the world. Even though the restaurant was full, servers were attentive and the wine selection good and reasonably priced. The hotel arranged car service to take us shopping a few miles away and then to the airport for much less than market price and in an air conditioned car with bottled water. They also arranged a late very check out at no additional cost. Both nights we were here there were large weddings but the hotel easily served guests and residents alike. It is a lovely property with beautiful pool and grounds. We enjoyed our stay. "
"It was really nice . Service was fantastic given by fahad,malinda and manager ruwan.food was awesome . Guge buffuet. Live band plaing .Thanks to mr herby given the guideline to the meal experrence. Highly recommond this place"
"Excellent food and service. Food from all corners of Asia. ,Fresh fruit juice bar was perfect in the Sri Lanka heat. ,Another excellent table that you have to try is the great sea food table with oysters and much much more! ,The kids loved the massive desert table :)!! ,Ask for Samadhi, best service in Sri Lanka"
"Fantastic food, arrangement and outlook. Beautifully organised food festival. Authentic and yummy. On the spot preparation. Attentive staff running around with all the support and clarifications. More than all above super entertainment with old Tamil,Songs and dances."
"We dined twice in a Japanese restaurant in the lobby, the guy kinala was amazing and at a high level of professionalism. He was knowledgeable and had shown great passion in his job, when we are passing by the lobby, we are anticipating to see him to say “hi” he agreed for us to have his picture taken,. (attached )We made friends with him ;)"
"We had a lovely time!! Great food!! Great atmosphere!! Loved every minute of it. Service was excellent. Cultural entertainment was superb. Will come back again next year!! ,Namal, Udakaran, Herby, Ishara, Sanka, Disira helped us out."
"We were on holiday for past three weeks. Stayed in 08 different hotels in Sri Lanka and Maldives.. Finally decided to write a review about this hotel. Because  they created some  great  memories. That will never forget. ,At the beginning doorman welcome us with a great smile, And we were checked in by Chamath at the front desk. Me and my husband were surprised by his professionalism. He provide us an upgrade to a Premium room before we even ask.. he always know what customer wants and always smiling. He called us every day during our stay to enusure everything thing is in order. And I would like to recommend Rasika from thaprobane restaurant. We glad to see this great staff. And to visit cinnamon again. Thank you Chamath and all Cinnamon grand staff for giving us unforgettable memories."
Just left the Jaffna food festival at Nuga Gama. A very well executed idea with a fantastic variety of food. The atmosphere they've created adds to the whole event. The crab curry is highly recommended. Malinda and team were very attentive.
"Absolutely good food with great variety of dishes. It has a great a jaffna environment with typical Jaffna dances and music. There are a lot of good beverages. Sanka, Herby, Namal, Anoj and them provided great services as well"
"Whenever i visit  cinnamon grand i never missed breeze bar . There are other hotels popping up in colombo but nothing can beat this lovely atmosphere .breeze bar and noodles became my favourite outlets right now. ,Specially i would like to thank mr.chandika for his great exceptional service. I always see him trying to help other guests too . (Keep it up young man-  quality of good hotelier ) ,Specially yesterday he just gave a great service since its Valentine's day we wanted to make it memorable so we chose breeze bar and chandika helped us alot . Thank you so much. , ,Highly recommended. "
"Amazing culinary experience with variety of dishes and hint of cultural sophistication of Jafna. Friendly people and soothing environment.Had a lovely time with my friends. A night well spent.,Thanks Nirosh Wasalage"
"Chandimal , Fernando,Dunstable at the concierge have been helpful,friendly,and great members of the staff.,Made our visit very welcome.,Always willing to help.,Valuable members of the Cinnamon team ,They Should be encouraged more to take part in customer relations."
We're not disappointed to come this beautiful restaurant. Excellent staff .Dilani recommended some delicious dishes that we were soo satisfied .positively we will be seeing in the hotel to dine in again
"Great ambience, and amazing variety of food. ,Very friendly guys around and this chap is amazingly friendly.,Lots of activity to keep the night going.,Great work by cinnamon and I hope they keep this up.,Cheers"
"In January 2019 I had the pleasure of staying at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo in an executive room with lounge access.  This was money very well spent! ,We entered a well appointed and clean room that overlooked the pool and with complementary wine on arrival. After a hot day being out and about in Colombo, it was lovely to return to room with fresh fruit and delicious chocolates with the nightly turndown service. ,Our stay included daily breakfast, high tea and happy hour in the executive lounge. ,The food range and quality was consistent, and most importantly accompanied with fantastic hospitality and service. It was loverly to be greeted on entry with smiles and shown to our table.  Little things like the staff remembering our coffee, tea and cocktail preferences and arranging for special breakfast, fruit or drink requests to be made available the next day added to the feeling of being indulged and spoilt. ,I can't wait for my next visit."
"We had a new setup today in Nuga Gama. Its was decorated with Jaffna theme. Its was a nice experience for our foreign friends from Estonia as well. We enjoyed the food of course. Also staff was very nice and courteous, specially Mangala, Dhananjaya, Herby, Sankha and Diseera. Thanks"
"we were originally heading for lagoon restaurant and we herad this awesome new experience taking place in nugagama, jaffna food festival with a wide varity of jaffna foods and cultural segments. we were really amused by the cultural surprise we had here and it was pretty awsome. highly recommend visiting jaffana food festival for a differenet experience in colombo food secene, special thanks goes to mangala for friendly guide through out the food festival. highly recommend"
"Had great time one of biggest food range of jaffna food and had after long time that taste good specially the mutton, fish curries, vegetables and sweets. Atomesphere and the cultural shows show case the Jaffna culture. The service of the staff was great specially Ruwan and Fahad was extraordinary that looked after our family attending to all individual requests."
The lunch was great. The pizza and the pasta I had tasted like authentic Italian and the tiramisu I had for dessert was very nice. The pizza was thinking crust and the cheeses very very good. The curator Pradeep who served us was very attentive
"Hotel is really grand. And to add to it the Sri Lankan people are really sweet and joyous. Overall the location is adjoining the beach side which is nice to go walking. There is a small mall kinda thing in the basement or maybe adjoining the hotel if you don't feel like going far from the hotel. There are many multi cuisines restaurant serving Indian (south indian ), Chinese and Italian food as per my knowledge. The house keeping staff is very hospitable. The hotel accepts USD more than its own local currency but they do give good value of USD. Better to use USD over their local currency inside the hotel premises. Different kinds of tea at its best price and taste one can have in and around Colombo. You may also catch few marriages whilst your stay there as I did in my three days of stay twice hehehe."
"Best seafood restaurant in Srilanka. Quality Quantity and Price is unmatched by any other place.,Friendly staff specially Mr Ranjith and Chef Piyal.,Nice amibiance and very clean.,All the best for a nice future"
"We were here for several nights as part of a tour. The place was amazing. The rooms were well appointed, the grounds were fun to wander around, the food was delicious and the staff were warm and inviting. I doubt you will disappointed if you stay here.   "
"This 5 star hotel is well appointed and has a great big pool. However, it is so large and weirdly designed over 3 badly-linked buildings that we kept getting lost to get from our room to the garden or the restaurant. You have to change elevators and cross 2 vast lobbies bigger than football fields.,The breakfast spread is absolutely amazing. Never seen anything like it ! And they make hoppers on demand too."
"This is a very nice hotel în Colombo with kind people and very delicious food. Rooms are very clean, the breakfast îs excelent with a various meals. The pool îs also clean and big enough for enjoying it. Next time i ll visit SRI Lanka, i will for sure choose the same hotel. "
"We went out for a Sunday Night dinner-and the ambience was really good. The staff was super helpful-Especially if you can’t decide what to eat!  Dilani and Malinda, who served us, were very attentive. The food was good and seemed authentic, the wait was not that long and overall it was a nice experience."
"A fantastic experience visiting Cinnamon Grand. The customer service is particularly outstanding. We were greeted by Chandimal who provided an excellent check-in and hotel overview. The service was particularly good as we arrived to Cinnamon Grand late at night. The rooms were beautiful. The facilities including swimming pool, gym and poolside bar area are fantastic. Finally the moring breakfast was varied, included lots of Sri Lankan food and was delicious! 5 stars and we look forward to visiting again."
"We enjoyed an amazing dinner at Nagagama Mangala, true authentic Sri Lankan food paired with an wonderful cultural experience. The curries were extremely tasty with a huge variety from crab and pork to fresh vegetable curries. The star of the show  however, were the hoppers. They were made to perfection and some of the best we’ve tried in the city. ,Along with the great food, you also get to experience true Sri Lankan dancing and music. The talented team put on an unforgettable show that you won’t get anywhere else. ,Lastly, the staff were excellent. They greeted us with a smile and were extremely attentive throughout the night. I would definitely recommend putting Nagagama on the top of your list."
Nuwan served me with excellent and appropriate communication also was very polite and approachable by his charisma. I enjoy the meal he brought to the room and marvelous experience in giving advice about food also. Thank you so much 
"This is my third dinner visit for the noodles in cinnamon grand. I would give 5 stars rating for the excellent service and foods. Specially Chamath,Ashan and kesara didn’t a gread job. Thank you Chamath. Thumbs up"
"I do highly recommend noodles.This is my third visit to noodles.This is the place I did my romantic wedding proposal to my fiancee.Specially Chamath,kesara & ashan did a great service to make it done.great job.thankz.keep it up."
We had really good food here. Their local pancakes with coconut milk(paal apam) was simply delicious. The rooms were comfy but a little dusty. The kids and I had a good stay and rest as we did a lot of traveling in Sri Lanka. Tq Cinnamon Grand Hotel for your hospitality.
Stayed at this beautiful property during our wedding time. Central Location and the great ambiance is the highlight of the property which has a good history. Service is very much upto standards and the lobby area is one of the best hang out spots in the capital which is calming and inviting to guests. 
"Thankyou Hashi for your great service highly appreviate your service .and slso we can rate 200% grate  about  food we had.,LAGOON  is the best seafood  restaurant  in Colombo  highly recommend  this plsce we had modhared curry was really nice,Rsnjith have sugested the dish."

"Excellent food and great service, personalized service by Danajaya. We had great evening. We thank the hospitality of Mangala, Nishal and Ishra. Our friends from Japan was overwhelmed with the courteous hospitality extended by the Nugagama staff. Hats off to the men that will not be seen at all the Chief and the Kitchen Staff without whom the food would have not have the authenticity that was get by us."
"I came with my partner we had a nice time food is so nice.gave us a good service specially hashi had a chat and she cover up our tsble thankuou hashi for your  hospitality  service.,Our order taken by Eranga gave a good combination  really enjoyed  the meal."

"It was a good stay at executive lounge the service staff is excellent  . Specially  thanks to saldin, stanislaus , kaveesha  , dhanushka we will come back  again .  Nice food .. ,Lot of restaurants so many choices  ....."
"Made a spontaneous decision to have dinner at Echo and that was the best decision I made all day. The food was amazing and it was very quick and I was served by Pradeep who is a top notch guy. The Ravioli is excellent, will be back to try the Pizza."
You will feel like entering in to a old village. Nice arrangement under a big nuga tree. Delicious Sri Lankan food. Friendly service. If you need a pure Sri Lankan experience you should go there.nice experience.
"As if my stay in Cinnamon Grand wasn’t comfortable enough, with all my needs attended to, then came my experience at Nuga Gama. Place was amazing, you get treated to this traditional village vibe indeed making you feel back to Sri Lankan roots. The food was even more amazing, with a wide selection of signature Sri Lankan dishes. And the curry - I tried em all and I had to go back for seconds! My mouth might be burning from all the spice but I leave the place smiling and happy. Highly recommended!"
"Hotel was ok. Rooms were a bit outdated and smelled a bit funny, probably from the moisture. Last night though I dined at the Italian restaurant, “Echo”. Food was top class and curator Pardeep  did everything he could to make us feel like home. "
Food was amazing at a great price. Service was mi nirosh  Mr gayan quick and efficient. We ordered the laksa & Thai basil chicken noodle which came really fast and tasted yummy. Our favourite was the green mango salad. Do call ahead and book early if you are planning on coming on a weekend.
"Excellent staff who go out of the way for guests. when I told Leeza (who processed my check in) that I’d forgotten my phone at the airport, she called the hotel rep at the airport who found my ph and sent to my room within a couple of hours. Hotel staff are wonderfully warm and courteous. ,The food is great and the rooms comfortable and clean. Highly recommend this hotel"
"Ordered Losbster ravioli as the starter it was very succulent, I ordered the mee goreng, great portion, great taste, was served by Nirosh, good service. Pricing was moderate, good value for money all around, great ambiance."
"The experience was great. Highly recommend. Can’t believe it’s in the middle of Colombo. ,The manager Mangala is an amazing host. ,Kudos the Nuga Gama Team!!!!,Happy Customer from Bangladesh . Hope that everyone makes time to come here at least once."
"Just visited Tao at the Cinnamon Grand hotel for a wonderful meal. The atmosphere was very relaxing and welcoming and our waiter Chaminda was great! The food and service were excellent! ,I particularly enjoyed the duck and the local beer called lion lager.  Also very excited to try the wonderful looking macaroons that we purchased from the lobby on the way. The doorman was laps friendly and the green tea was the best we’ve ever had, it was complimentary."
"Great excellent brilliant service,Best what a nice environment .,Nisal,Krishamal,Ishara & how ever great maneger ruwan , very kind smile & awesome treat for us. Thank you best recommended restaurant in colombo area ."
"we made a reservations  through  the phone with Hashi she gave us a good table and taking care of us specially  we came with our kids she assist us very nicely.,and also our order was taken by Channa good varieties  he selected the best dishes.,service done by shirath and savindra they gave a great service.food is great really annoyed .tbankyou lagoon staff for your  great service will be back."
"We just came with my friend to have dinner wonderful had a chance to find a table without a reservation by Hashi. She gave a nice service smoothly everything went.lovely dinner we had.and also want to mention shirath and danuka gave us  good service too.,Food is so delicious as usual very fresh."
"We checked in at about 1:30am due to a late arriving flight and the check in process was  standard and smooth.,We got a Courtyard Suite and it was a lovely spacious room ( a living room, a big bedroom and two full bathrooms).,The service we received at this hotel was amazing!  Prince at the front desk was FANTASTIC! This gentleman has such excellent customer service.  We encountered some issues with arranging travel to another city and Prince went above and beyond to help us resolve our problem.  Please give this guy a raise!  :-),Also we had exemplary service from Malinda at the Chinese restaurant.  Our kids were so jet lagged that they fell asleep at the table, but Malinda made sure that the food we ordered was sent up to the room so that the kids could eat something if they woke up hungry. It was touching how much he was concerned about our kids.,In short, a beautiful hotel with great customer service!  Special shout out to Prince!! Bravo!"
"The Cinnamon Grand is a big hotel in a convenient location in Colombo. You can walk to many sites, however you're better off to take a tuktuk because of the heat. Service was generally good. The breakfast spread was good with a lot of variety; there was excellent Sri Lankan food (hoppers, dosa, etc.). The rooms however were pretty basic and there was a loud event in the central court area when we were staying there."
Breeze bar is the best place to relax with friends. Cocktails was awsome . Nice atmosphere. Tapas food was delicious. Fahad and priyadarshana they are very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this place . Thanks to manager upali
The food and service at the Breeze Bar was excellent. The wrap was very tasty and the music was great. As I could not decide what to get the server (Priyada Shana) patiently went through the menu and recommended a few options. 5 star service
Inside the big ass hotel. Excellent environment & food! I think that’s top Chinese restaurant of the nation. Main chef from China. Waitress knows Chinese that supervised me.  Certainly I will be visited again.
"We have been here so many times staying at cinnamon grand came down for vacation.had a great stay during our vacation at Cinnomon grand. We dinned at Lagoon met Hashi from the beginning she is the one who take care of us.quickly she done the service to our table great service Hashi thank you so much.,Food is so tasty really enjoyed chicken black pepper fried noodles vegetable rice suggested by Hashi.good combination., Thankyou once again lagoon best seafood restaurant in town."
Excellent service. Excellent good. The staff are very courteous and friendly. The food is exquisite. Proper SL village food cooked in Clay pots with proper SL spices. The ambience is great as well. Definitely gonna come back again
"We missed the buffet at Echo..,But the staff made up for it offering Ala Carte.  Asoka the Manager and Mirshad made up by offering us a nice menu..food was made to perfection. The service and the staff made it a beautiful evening for us."
"Excellent service by the two managers and staff. Great food. Highly recommend the salmon as a must try dish,cooked to perfection.Thank you for the super service.looking forward to the new menu which is to be put out soon."
"Most important, the room was very clean, spacious with a lot of light coming in and good curtains if you want to keep it out. The wifi and working conditions are excellent be it in the room or the executive lounge. The hotel also operates their own car fleet which allows for fast and comfortable transport. I have not stayed at a better Hotel in a long while. The Hotel has 14 restaurants which provide a good selection of food. The entire hotel is well maintained and is in the heart of Colombo with greats views over it. The staff is extremely helpful especially in the Executive Lounge, Saldin was of great help."
"The food was as usual delicious.actually we really like this restaurant because of the quality of food and quality of the service which we getting all the time.this time also we met Hashi.so lucky to get a service from her doing with her smile however she busy.,The restaurant was busy at a stretch yesterday but didn’t disappoint by the staff.,Food is great 100% the best sea"
"I am currently staying at Cinnamon Grand on a business visit. Since my arrival on the 26th I’ve had nothing but the most best experience especially dealing with the staff at the executive lounge. Their hospitality and the down to earth nature had made my stay a memorable one. My special thanks goes to Chamila, Saladin, Sanjeewa, kaveesha, Danushka, Adeesha and Anthony. I also would like to thank Asanka Director and Brian (Manager). They have always gone out of their way to ensure that my stay is unique and comfortable. Keep up the good work guys. "
"The ambiance, the customer service and the way they suggest food was just too perfect. If not for Channa (Restaurant Manager), i will never order a Crab for our table. He is the one who suggested to try it out. Which was heavenly. Thank you Lagoon and Channa for the amazing experience."
"We stayed at the Cinnamon Grand on the last days of our holiday having had a great experience at Cinnamon Red.  The two hotels are different in style but again the hotel delivered as promised.  We had picked the Grand as we wanted to be able to walk up to Galle Face for sunset but also have a shower and change before getting on our midnight flight home (and without having to pay for that night's accommodation).  The Cinnamon Grand gave us a late check out (till 6pm) free of charge and then allowed us to use the ""hospitality lounge"".  We had the lounge to ourselves which had a TV, couches, water and  a male and female bathroom with shower, towels and toiletries. Best late check out ever.  PS - I had happened on the existence of the hospitality lounge when I was searching their site and we had to ask for it to be opened to us but it was worth it and I wouldn't hesitate to ask."
"Wonderful out door and under an enormous banyan tree restaurant. Buffets are noon and evening and consist of authentic Sri Lankan food including delicious deserts. Every Monday night a cultural revue is presented. Excellent. The waiters and support staff are ever eager provide assistance and information. In particular are: Mangala, Nisal, Krimal. ,If ever in Colombo, check out the Cinnamon Grand.  "
"Landed in Colombo after long flight, very large atrium entrance, rather soulless, vast, impersonal, needed sat- nav to locate the lift, reception staff remote and unwelcoming, however bar and restaurant staff polite and accommodating. ,Rooms large and contained most requirements, bed very comfortable.,Felt like I was staying in an  airdrome."
"I organized a 21st Birthday party for my brother at Cheers Pub. A special mention to chef Kemin who assisted me on preparing the menu for 20 pax which all of us loved. And a big thanks to Romesh, Madura and Chef Senadira."
"We stayed one night at this nice hotel before we went back home. The service was good and the food was amazing. We celebrated new years eve here, and joined for the celebration arranged by the hotel. It was a really great experience."
One of the greatest hotel in colombo. Love this place because of welcoming atmosphere. Staff is really helpful & polite. Lagoon restaurant is highly recommended for sea food. Prices are reasonable. Excellent service in all times.
"Arrived a little fatigued at 0030, had to get a receptionist to come to us. When he did he was very nice and sent us off with bags to the seventh floor. Keys didn’t work, gentleman with us said we could sort AM. I said for safety we needed a key,went back, came back, still didn’t work. I went back to reception and got a change of room, which I insisted on doing ourself. Hotel is contemporary and staff great. Cheers bar is okay. On last night there was a sound outside the hotel or in it, like a light aircraft, as we were up at 230am I rang reception and it was stopped??? Seriously at these prices none of our experience should have happened."
"We stayed at both the Kingsbury (for new year’s eve) and at the Cinnamon Grand at the end of our visit to Sri Lanka. The Kingsbury is a great hotel and its rooftop bar was perfect for the new year’s eve fireworks, but the Cinnamon Grand was the prefect way to finish off our vacation. It is like a city within a city. It has 14 restaurants of all different types of food, plenty of bars and cafe areas, a fantastic breakfast buffet, a great pool area with bar, excellent general facilities, and very helpful staff. A special mention to Leeza Fernando who looked after us wonderfully throughout our stay. We had a hitch with our booking (our fault) and Leeza handled everything, and followed up with emails etc, and then went out of her way to help us when we arrived and left. A special thankyou from the Nolan’s and the the Flipo’s!"
"Colombo can a busy hectic messy place. Coming to the Grand Cinnamon felt like a civilised oasis. It is a beautiful grand hotel. Our room are comfortable, but was on the small side. My young kids enjoyed the pool which was great size.,The negative that I must mention is that we had an issue with our booking where we booked and paid for a room for 2 adults and 2 kids. But when we got there there was only one queen bed. After many discussions with the staff at reception, they blamed the company that sold me the room for not making this clear and I ended up having to pay for an extra bed. I was certainly not happy about this."
"I do not normally write a review until I have left the hotel however, on this occasion the level of service has been such that I am completing this one prior to checking out. No task has been too small for the Guest Services and butler staff to assist me with. As I am here for work I have used the Cinnamon Lounge daily once again all the members of staff here were helpful including in their choices of Sri Lanka food to experience. The room was well equipped to my needs the bed for me especially comfortable. The only other area I used regularly was the gym which had more than sufficient equipment and very spacious. Finally there are too many names of the staff that have gone extra mile in excellent customer service to mention as it would fill this review. ,All on the executive floor team should be congratulated by their supervisors.,Tharaka, Salman, Indika and Mario have been especially of help.,I did also have the pleasure of speaking to the Asanka Fernando AVP rooms division. I have already booked my stay for next work assignment in Sri Lanka at this hotel. Thanks to all I apologies for not having all the names."
"visited with family an year after have given an excellent review. Simply couldn'd believe the drop in quality in food and drinks. all the food ordered were that of 3rd grade quality.,pictures will speak volumes. too disappointing to describe each item. ,the staff are extremely hospitable with a smile. Given that i am still fond of this property i suggest that is anyone is interested in getting an honest feedback may contact me."
Had a magnificent authentic Sri Lankan dinner at Nugagama followed by a drink at the Tea Lounge . Every thing about this hotel is just great including a young gentleman by the name of Fahim who was most helpful. Certainly stay here next time in Colombo. 
The best botel to stay at Colombo great ambience and cool location just walking distance to beach. Awesome food with sea food mix. A biggest group of hotel in sri lanka u will be surprised by facilities and also free transfer to casino
"Did a last minute trip for NYE and 4 nights to Colombo. ,Picked this hotel on its scores and reviews. Wasn't disappointed. ,Grand foyer with lots of places extending off. ,Arrived early morning , and was accommodated well and we even got our room by 10am. Thank you. ,Very buzzy hotel, lots of people , great atmosphere, weddings going on in banquet hall's. ,Staff were excellent  , polite , friendly and happy. I don't think we encountered anyone not like this. Well done! ,My only down , even then not a huge thing , was the rooms. A little dated and worn, bathroom slighty small. But this isn't really a wrong. ,The beds are so very comfy , and the facilities in the room are great  , like kettle,  tea, water. ,All little touches. ,Would I stay again , yes. "
The ambience is beautiful food is amazing and staff outstanding. Amazing spread.  Ruwan Dhananjaya Francis and the team are friendly and their service exceptional. Will definitely come again for the place and service.
"Can’t say anything bad about his terrific hotel. Service was impeccable, including a flawless airport pickup and drop off. The breakfasts were out of this world with every option imaginable from very healthy to indulgently less healthy. Local food options as well. The variety of dining inside this hotel is great and the shopping mall just outside the lobby entrance (turn left) was incredibly conviennent. Need souvenirs? Head over to the Dilmah Tea store just inside the mall. Great combinations at low prices. Hotel perfectly located in Colombo. This is my hotel in this city from now on... Head to the Cheers bar in the basement for a true pub feel with smoking completely acceptable!!!! "
"The Cinnamon Grand has it all. Grand reception area , coffee shop, piano lounge  , restaurants and bars. ,Staff are friendly and courteous. The shopping mall attached to the hotel is convenient with a grocery, liquor shop and pharmacy in the basement of the centre. The location of the Cinnamon Grand is convenient , and just a five minute stroll to Galle Face Green. If you’re taking an Uber anywhere it’s a short fare from the Cinnamon Grand . Rooms are comfortable and clean. Linen is crisp and white . Overall a great hotel. "
Very good service and attended by great service  personal   specifically  Mr.Anuradha and Mr.Mahesh of Thaprobane  Restaurant. The food was good. Was looking for tasty food and a quick bite. But stayed for longer than expected  and ate more than expected  because  of good food and excellent service.
"It is really great and we enjoyed well. Foods are excellent with local taste.Music was awasom ,we enjoyed well.eaiMangala,Ruwan,Ishara , Christmal and Nisal given us excellent service during our dinner.,We will be back."

Excellent location to walk to Pettah Markets, Galle Face Green waterfront, Dutch Hospital and Colombo Fort,Thanks to all staff who were of a very high standard in a country still adjusting to the western tourist influx.,We would come again and will recommend to all considering a stay in Colombo,Xxxxxx"
"We had a delightful meal at Noodles and Nirosh was quite hospitable! We each had mee goreng and vermichilli with pork and they were to die for! We were also seated in a very lit but almost private place, which made the date all happy! Much recommended. Cheers"

"Had a good time at Nuga Gama restaurant. Really good Sri Lankan style food and good service. Nice environment.,Thanks to Ruwan and his team Dhananjaya, wasalage, and Ishara.,I highly recommend this place for everyone."

"Had an amazing time , food & beverages are amazing ! Ideal place in Colombo for a family dinner. Soft music & Italian food. The management is so amazing that they took an extra mile to surprise my sibling on his birthday dinner here."
"Great tranquil environment and best tasting food. The food selection is amazing, a treat for indian food lovers. Also to mention the best service from the staff, especially Manager John was exceptionally helpful in helping us choosing the menu.,If you are there next time and would want some help in selection best bet would be John, the manager. ,John and the team, thank you and your service and the quality of the restaurant is well above the rest. Keep up the good work and hope to return soon!"
"Cinnamon has been one of the best hotels for me when it comes to in-room dining. Service is always quick and I always loved it when they serve my tray with a flower on the side! Today, my server, Roshan, has been kind. He asked how my day has been and served my food with a big smile on his face. As always, crew is always friendly and approachable. "
"Great food, excellent service, amazing ambience, wonderful setting. Open air dining with carp swimming past as you eat your meal seated on decking amongst palm trees and ponds. Our waiter Melinda was extremely attentive and friendly.,Truly great dining experience."
Excellent food and service. Loved the staff ...special mention of Nuwan and Dhananja who were extremely cordial and excellent service. Loved the tranquillity and the light music was extremely enjoyable.
Chutneys holds an exciting and very tasteful South Indian vegetarian dinner buffet every Tuesday which features items from all across South India at an affordable cost with an excellent service. This last Tuesday was Thai Pongal Day and they held a buffet specifically intended to celebrate that event the interior decor and food was specifically made to celebrate this event and was a marvelous experiace
"Pleasant rooms, friendly helpful staff, clean, comfortable and with absolutely outstanding restaurants (all of the on site restaurants are in the top 20 in Colombo).   We changed our trip to grab a couple of nights at the end of our visit to Sri Lanka.   This is the best hotel I've ever stayed in."

We visited Nuga Gama restaurant for dinner and their service was exceptional. Also the food was authentic and tasty. Ruwan and Dananjaya were very friendly and their service was excellent. Highly recommended!
"Our family stayed a week. Very pleasant. Plenty of food choices, good place to sample local food & reasonable prices. Hotel was busy, popular for locals as well.

"This was by far one of the best Sri Lankan food I've ever tasted. Mangala, ishara,Nisal, and Krismal was great. They all gave us the best service and experience for our evening. I would highly recommend this place. Keep up the great work."
"Food was really good and felt like I'm in Japan again as we ordered what we liked in Japan. The people there were very friendly and helpful always with a pleasant smile. The price is reasonable and I would recommend this to food lovers. ,Thank you all for the good food and time."
We had dinner at Tao Restaurant in the Cinnamon Grand and it was a wonderful experience. After living more than 2 years in Sri Lanka I must say this was the best dining experience so far. The Restaurant and its ambience is wonderful and so calm and like a hideaway in the big city. The service is excellent and the waiters know their menu and are super friendly. And the food was so tasty. I can highly recommend this place.
Best place to have Sri Lankan authentic food in Nugagama restaurant .... helpful and friendly staff... specially Mr. Krishan F&Bis the best..  food is awesome choices many also the drinks. if someone wanna try authentic Sri Lankan good this is the best place to visit in Colombo cannot beat it thank you guys.. 
Had lunch at lagoon sea food restaurant at cinnomon grand. Sea food is nicely presented and the food is also really good. Drinks are also good. Specially cocktails. Staff is also very friendly and flexible. We were served by eranga and hashi.. they are very good and professional. Overall a pretty decent place to hv a seafood meal
"We had dinner in the Tao Chinese Restaurant at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel. ,The food was very delicious and the service excellent. We got food and wine recommendations from Dilani and her colleague. The price-performance ratio was really good (for european standard) and we would definitely recommend to come here, enjoy great service, delicious food in a very nice environment."
"Saldin and stanislaus , kaveesha adeesha I has a wonderful service and atmosphere which makes you feel at home!! I really recommend the executive lounge!!!!,Top notch!!! ,Beautiful attention and top notch attention!!"
Our tour in srilanka we however managed to get some booking in Tao. Dilani was so helpful from the beginning and fulfilled all our requirements. Big hats off to the nice lady. Food is avarage Chinese but service stands still
"This large, modern hotel offers well designed rooms and practical bathrooms.  My room had three huge windows and was a pleasure to stay in.  The bathroom had a shower that worked perfectly, was easy to understand and had no leaks.  The breakfast buffet was generous and tasty.  Dinner and a lunch at Noodles Restaurant were also satisfying.  Staff was pleasant and helpful."
"We had a great time at Lagoon Hashi made us a memorable dinner for us.always asking out feed back and taking care of us.our waiter priyanga also gave a good service.we always expect this kind of a service from a five star hotel can rate 100% to this restaurant.,Food was excellent very tasty.cuttlefish dish was superb well cooked.thankyou lagoon."
"The hotel itself is ok - it’s in need of an update but good choice of restaurants and facilities. The only real negative during our stay was the breakfast buffet which was a mess. Loads of food had run out, staff ignored us asking for hot drinks and the phone kept ringing.,Aside from the hotel, the reason for the review is to say a massive thank you to Prince on the front desk. Unfortunately, someone had accidentally taken my bag instead of their own off the bus from Tangalle. Prince went above and beyond to work with the bus company (and eventually the airport!) to help locate my bag and keep me updated. ,It’s the staff that really make a hotel experience and Prince was brilliant. "
"On the 12th of January, my family and I went for a relaxing dinner at the Taprobane. The food was not only delicious, it was well prepared and the hotel staff was extremely kind and welcoming. A special shout out to the manager , Nimal Shantha and the Supervisor,  Dilanka for the excellent service provided and for making my family and myself feel very welcomed. However the dessert bar could be improved by adding more desserts to give a variety . All in all, it was definitely a family dinner to remember "
"The hotel was nice and vibrant, we stayed during the new years and the celebrations were good. Just that the bar counter at the new year pool party was understaffed. The food was good and there are plenty of restaurant choices inside the hotel "
"We had a wonderful stay, enjoying the full range of the cinnamon facilities and delightful dining experiences. Even the room service was delicious and arrived in a timely manner. ,There are lots of nice hotel options in Columbo but what stood out for Cinnamon Grand was their outstanding service and consistently delicious food and meticulous kitchen standards."
"Very warm and welcoming service. One place should definately dine at in sri lanka.Superb sri lankan delicacy and surrounding was so sri lankan. Nirosh, Ruwan, Wasalage, kishmal, Dananjaya delighted me with a very friendly and warm service. Thanks to team"
"Marvelous food ! Ambiance and staff are very great ! ,Special thanks to dananjaya,rowan,wasalage krismar   great service that make the dinner more nice..amezing night.we come again that restaurant..!!!!! "
"The staff at cinnamon grand were amazing, best service from remembering your names and drink orders to their friendly charm, especially from the team at the executive lounge Mr Chamila, Mr Saldeed, Danushka and Adeesha. We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the executive floor was well worth the added perks of high tea and happy hour among many other inclusions. The hotel is beautiful and the pool is huge and so relaxing, well worth the price to stay here!"
"My partner and I came for our first trip to Sri Lanka and stayed at the Cinnamon Grand. From the moment we arrived we found the staff very welcoming and helpful. From the drivers to the concierges they made every effort to make our trip enjoyable. The pool area is amazing and very relaxing. In the executive lounge we were very well looked after by Mr Chamila, Mr Saldeed, Danishes and Adeesha who made sure every time we were up there we were well looked after and had a pleasurable experience. We had an excellent stay and I would happily come back to the Cinnamon Grand."
"Highly recommended to visit!,Nisal vasalage and danange and krishmal gave beautiful service. Dinner was amazing!,Different types of traditional dishes,Thank you for the hospitality!,We would love to come back"
Great hospitality all over the place and pleases are every where . Why a one should not revisit the place  . Admiration should go to Dilani who is a star  . Service stands in a high level and fresh breeze adds an extra point
"It was wonderful authentic Sri Lankan food experience. Service is very good  and ambiance is wonderful. Dhanjaya,Mangala & staff is very cooperative & polite. Highly recommended place in Colombo . Should give a visit with family . Truely delightful ."
"Love to share lovely experience we had at tao at cinnamon grand hotel , lovely food and hospitality for all the staff. View from the table of pool added to the food , and the cool breeze to carm us down , it’s a must try"
"We stayed two nights in this huge hotel. The overall facilities are good and there is always somewhere to eat as there are 14 restaurants! The service is also good.,However, the hotel lobby is always super crowded as there seems to be a wedding going on all the time. The food at the restaurants is good but the breakfast needs serious improvement. ,The rooms in what seems to be the older section need updating and the hallways are very dark."
"Best hotel ever cleanest the food was PERFECT! The personal was kind and helpful. Concierge Jeremy was so helpful for everything. Location is awsome and near everything you nees to see in Colombo. Thx to the staff for my beautiful xmas holidays. I warmly recomendit to everyone who wanna visit Sri lanka and have beautiful and unforgetable memories! I'll be back! ,Ivan/Macedonia"
The one of our most liked family restaurant and we always love this place. The service is so good and the staff is friendly and look after the customers so well. Super taste Italian food and have a good variety. Mirahad and Pradeep there done a super job and device.
"We usually visit Cinnamon grand during our vacations, without any prior notice we walked into the Lagoon restaurant but during their busy schedule they had time to arrange an extra table for us, finally two other friends joined us and altogether there were four of us. I appreciate the dedication of this team specially Hashi and Lakshan. One of the best service teams at Cinnamon I guess, extremely efficient and self motivated. ,Last but not least the seafood was excellent, fresh and tasty. "
I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this restaurant because both of the waiters made us feel so comfortable. Their smiles and friendly nature made this experience very memorable and I would love to come back here the next time I’m in the country.
"An amazing restaurant and such amazing friendly staff. Anthony, Mangala, Nisal, Ishara and Dhananjaya were all exceptional and from when we were first seated to the end, the exceptional service didn’t stop. Food was amazing and very traditional. Thank you "
"Thanking the administration of the Hotel. Had a great stay! Very much appreciate the Guest Relation Executive Mr Indika Anura Siriwardena. He is very professional & keen on every single requirement. Genuinely recommend this person. Though a quick business trip, I needed to visit the Sri Kadhirgama Shrine in Katagarama. Well, the very next day, the trip was successfully fabulous as planned by Mr.Indica. Food at the hotel was in itself an experience. Tried the traditional Sri Lankan breakfast & it was magnificent. Had lunch at the Noodles House : Splendid flavors! The spa was good.,By God's grace, will visit this hotel again with family this time. Cheers!"
"No wonder this place is number 1! We enjoyed food at Tao restaurant. The restaurant itself it so beautiful, we were sat right next to the pond! The service was exceptional by all servers, especially Dilani. Very quick and helpful from everyone. The food was stunning, we would love to come back again. Thanks everyone! You can’t miss this place so try to make it during your trip."
"We frequently indulge ourselves at their restaurants and coffee shop at this hotel and stayed two nights from 30 Dec to 01Jan. We love the location that has three access gates from two roads and the adjacent shopping mall & supermarket. Prices at the many restaurants (coffee shop, international, Indian, Chinese, Thai) and pubs are very reasonable compared to other five star hotels in the city of Colombo. The welcoming doormen, especially Mr Dias, coffee stop staff should be commended. Praneeth at the Taprobane 24 hr restaurant is an asset to the institution a dn you'll be lucky to be served by him. Sameera and the lanky, dusky Mahesh too are very experienced, attentive staff at this restaurant. Why do we keep patronizing this hotel when there are so many 5 star properties in the area???    "
"Beautiful night at the Nuga Gama restaurant. ,Amazing feast of traditional Sri Lanken food with sensational service. Lovely staff. ,100% recommended!,Everything about this hotel the Cinnamon Grand is 5 ️"
Food was really good. As Sri Lankans we experienced some new food too. Customer service is excellent and the cultural dance was educating and a good way to explore the Sri Lankan Culture. Totally would recommend this place to anyone.
"We visited the cinnamon grand for our first night in sri lanka as part of a week long tour. The lobby area is huge and impressive, full of people coming and going. Our check in was swift and smooth with friendly staff. The hotel is large with a staggering amount of resteraunts. Our room was large and very well appointed. It is located near galle face beach and this can be reached in about 10 minute on foot. We ate in the buffet resteraunt for dinner and breakfast. The food served was very nice but it was quite a hectic atmosphere. Not unpleasant. Just in keeping with the bustle of Colombos overall atmosphere. This hotel is a great over night hotel as a gateway to the rest of the country. Would recommend."
Excellent food. Excellent service! Kumara accomodated our last minute booking. We were looked after very well. There was a great selection of food for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Dilani provided great customer service and we had an incredible time at this restaurant. Definitely would recommend this to all!
"Attended a wedding reception at Oak Room, Cinnamon Grand. We had a lovely time and enjoyed everything. The menu and the food was fantastic. The service was the best. Enjoyed the music provided by the band. Everybody had a splendid time dancing. The table deco and the settings were really beautiful. Being Christmas time, the hotel was beautifully decorated and the whole place was illuminated. It was really awesome."
"The buffet had varities of seafood including varieties of fish,prawns,crab,cuttle fish cooked in authentic Srilankan style! It was definitely a good lunch for foodies! The customer service was good... Last, its a place with a picturesque view"
"It was a memorable journey to a mythical wonderland through the gates of Cinnamon Grand on the Christmas eve visiting ""Taprobane"" restaurant for buffet dinner. The environment they had created through decoration was very attractive and lovely. Atmosphere was great to up lift all spirits for Christmas!"
"We had a splendid time at Tao Restaurant. Not only was the food very good and the setting lovely, the service was the best we've had in Colombo. Dilani and her team greeted us very warmly and gave us good recommendations. We left, wanting only one thing, another occasion to come back.,See you soon, and thank you again."
Food is very good. One of the best restaurants in Colombo. And Dilani is amazing in personality and service. Love her service. Will defineatly visit cinnamon grand because of her. Lovely hotel and People serving
"Excellent food and very friendly staff (Nirosh, Mangala Nisal). Atmosphere is pleasent and really gives the feel of the Sri Lankan village experience.,Try the milk hoppers...they were great!,Will be back for sure.,Ranj"
"On the 22nd of December I went to thaprobane restaurant with my family for breakfast. It was myself/husband and the two kids(one toddler and one infant). The reason we went there was to celebrate our anniversary. We had other plans for evening so we decided to visit thaprobane for breakfast. We were warmly welcomed and served a table without a delay. But It took about 30 minutes for them to bring a baby chair and that too we had to remind them. Cutlery wasn’t on the table. Coffee/ tea was not served. No one was coming to pick the plates. It was a very busy day and I understand that. I always leave positive feed back here cos thaprobane is somewhere we visit to celebrate our special occasions. I was so disappointed that I found a hair in my milkrice. I informed the Stewart and he made the chef to come and talk to us. ,But after seeing that hair in my food I did not feel like eating anything. To be honest I could not enjoy my breakfast. We pay good money to have a meal at your restaurant so please make sure service is provided for the money that we pay."
What an amazing place with outstanding customerservice by mangala nirosh..Atmospher & the sorrounding is really awesome. Recommend for outbound & inbound both ppl.Guys if u visit Sri Lanka don't forget to keep ur footprints here for sure.
"We spent the evening at Cinnamon Grand’s Tao Chinese restaurant. The food was excellent and the staff were very helpful, especially our waiter Malinda who was able to recommend some very good dishes. This is probably one of the nicest Chinese restaurants in Colombo and I look forward to returning."
The service was great! The people there are very friendly. One of the best places to check out if you’re in the Colombo area.The food was just as good. Many options to choose from. The venue is beautiful and live music was enjoyed.
"Was in Nugagama on 02nd January for dinner. The staff were friendly & were really helpful and the atmosphier was excellently at Nugagama was the best... ,Would recommend for some good Sri Lankan dishes with Sri Lankan music :)"
"This is our seventh visit to this Hotel and we’ve never been disappointed with the service we receive.  The rooms are super clean and airy thanks to Anne Krause from Housekeeping and her team who makes sure this is taken care of.  We’re always in awe of the sumptuous buffet breakfasts we’ve had each morning.  There’s a myriad of shops in the adjoining Crescat complex to satisfy your every need.  It’s located on the main Galle Road, close to Galle Face Green and the city centre (Fort).  Central for setting out for any Colombo sightseeing or Business."
"I stayed here while performing in Mamma Mia! at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre. The room was great, the amount of restaurants was amazing, and all really good quality and selection of food. The pools were wonderful to spend time at, It's great to have the use of the Spa roof top pool as well, when the main one was too full. I enjoyed the celebrations on New Years Eve and partied by the pool. It's been lovely to have so much live music in so many areas to enjoy over the Christmas period. I highly recommend this Hotel! thankyou!"
"I had not stayed  here but many tried many resturants within, all had unique taste on it's own.,Chinese to Authentic Sri Lankan. ,Also main buffet is alos unique,,Nuga Gama is just amazing true sri Lankan authentic food one should never miss...! "
"I had a shocking experienced when I was hosting two friends for lunch this afternoon, one of my friends discovered a worm in my Laksa noodles in the Noodles Restaurant (2nd January 2019), pictures are below, It is rather disgusting to note that a Five Star Hotel has fails to maintain hygienic standards, especially in food served, of a high degree as expected. We complained to the staff immediately but there appeared to be no ready response to assuage the situation, since it was an overt glaring disaster to the reputation of your hotel."
Delicious food. So much options for all dietary requirements. The curry was delicious and there was a lot of options for rice dishes. The staff were very kind and helpful. I highly recommend this buffet.
"The service and food at nuga gama was the excellent. Ruwan, Krishmal, Wasalage, Ishara and Dananjaya in particular took special steps to make sure that we were well taken care of. Great experience all round."
"Amazing atmosphere, amazing food and to top it off wonderful service from the staff (Dananjaya, Ruwan, Krismal, Wasalage , Ishara ),Will definitely come here again as we had a great time .,Thank you again !!"
"Great stay with my family and totally recommended for any type of visit. The food, staff and services were absolutely above very best. Have many restaurants and bars. Seafood restaurant was my kids favorite as they provide many varieties of seafood dishes."
"We came through HSBC it was a great dinner we had me and my wife our table has take care by Hashi very kind and so loving always giving a best hospitality service.very nice to talk with her and meeting her.,Food was excellent we are so pleasure to dine in here. Thank you for introducing this restaurant as best seafood restaurant."
"Excellent as always was the ambience specially being the Christmas season. Customer service and all arrangements for the wedding function was great. Food .... the buffer spread was excellent and the batter fried prawns, pork slices and Alaska pudding should not be missed. The directions from underground car park to the lift to come to the lobby should be improved and maintained better. "
Had the best experience with mr Nirosh and mr Wasalage while eating at Nuga Gama. We were 10 people eating there and they did a terrific job making sure that we always had what we needed. They gave great tips of what sri lankan specialities we should try and explained sri lanka food culture. Thanks mr Nirosh and mr Wasalage. We visited in july but I still remember this night and these guys.
"Good place lot of activities 40% discount coupon for mamamia show.,Excellent menu spa swimming pool all the amennities kids love the pool shopping mall is close by good for family free internet and good for vacations time.spent "
"We went there for a dinner. It was very quiet. Maybe due to few guests.,Food was good, live traditional music.,Stuff were nice.,Since I didn't pay for it, I'm not sure about the price. I would go back again.,It's all you can eat."
As regular client to Nuga Gama i  like the Sri Lankan thier food very tasty and according to traditional cooking.i would like to thank entire team of nugagma for their excellent service.also hostress ms.nilmini and Nirosh

"Met Prince 2 days ago at the lobby. Clicked instantly with him because of his bubbly and outgoing personality. We came back after lunch and talked to prince regarding rooms and rates, prince was very informative. We all had a laugh and came back yesterday to checkin to the hotel. Met Leeza, jenifer and another young gentleman at the reception. Started off our conversation with a laugh. All 3 were very helpful and had an amazing sense of humor.,They all went over and beyond to assist us and get the best possible room for us according to our requirements. ,Overall we had an amazing experience. I believe that people do business with people they like, which is why we should really appreciate the work these guys are doing and hire more people like prince jenifer and leeza. ,We are definitely coming back and recommending cinnamon grand to all our friends and family..,All the very best guys and keep up the amazing work.. Keep smiling, It's contagious "
"Excellent service and food at this place.. amazing atmosphere.. if someone wants to enjoy Sri Lankan food, Nuga Game is the best place in Colombo. Take your time to enjoy a variety of dishes.. Specially the black pork curry.."

"Roshan from room service is a very hard working and a down to earth, he went out of the way to do the service and very polite and courteous, he is very polite and best staff in this Hotel. I am very happy with the service of the hotel "
"Stayed here in December with my family and wanted to commend the staff for an amazing job of taking care of us. From check in to the time of departure, everything was perfect. Rooms were nice and clean, staff was friendly and always willing to help. We will definitely be back for a longer stay. "
"This was my third visit to the Cinnamon Grand and it just keeps on improving.,With all the restaurants and bars plus top notch hospitality everyone is catered for. ,I would choose no other place to stay in Colombo.,I would like to add a special mention to Prince who helped me with my bags and the car as I was leaving too.,And many thanks to all the wonderful staff who help make the hotel such a gem.,See you again soon!

"Amazing local cuisine with really friendly staff!  Loved the hospitality and the wide variety of home cooked Sri Lankan food.  The atmosphere was nothing short of a old Ceylonese village, really made me feel at home! Nisal, kudos to you and team! "
Great authentic Sri Lankan food. Great local ambiance and a nod to local etiquette. The restaurant was very crowded that night.  Niroshan has given a great support to make it a very memorable night. Good effort. Thank you Cinnamon Grand !
Our favourite place for good food and excellent service. The Lagoon has always maintained the highest standards. A special mention to Hashi  who is always very pleasant and always offers a very good service at the highest level. Hashi is exceptional and hope to see her again at The Lagoon.
"I and my husband normally visit Taprobane at Cinnomon Grand when we crave for a buffet and let me tell you this restaurant food, service and atmosphere never have disappointed us any day. Each time of visiting I get amazed how these people maintain level best standards after all these years.. The staff at Taprobane is well-trained, disciplined and respectful for each and every customer and I want to give a special thanks to Cinnomon Grand for training their staff like this. Hats off..,Every food we tried at breakfast and dinner buffets here are beyond words tasty. We never miss the smoothies and danish pastries at breakfast buffet. Keep up the good standards going on like this guys.. Amazing"
"Only visited the coffee shop. Poor service, forgetful waiters, despite a lot of them being about. Loud lobby, not a great place to meet for a chat, that's for sure. Coffee was average, cake was good but nothing to write home about. "
"great location, nice bed, good food for brekfast, i also tried restaurant there for dinner, very good seafood there, i also like chocolate here in your hotel, but a little far from my room 522 to the guest lift, but it's ok, walking is good for health"
"We visited this restaurant to have seafood.we successfully finished the dinner without any hesitation Hashi gave a good service with her full of strength since she was in a busy environment.,As she recommended some dishes we ordered food timing everything smoothly went.but everyone was busy but the staff didn’t forget us.,After dinner Hashi has take us to the Christmas Market because she was promoting the jam flavors.very nice it was home made jam very delicious.,Thankyou Hashi you are amazing.will come back.all the best to you and your Cinnamongrand.cheers"
I frequently  visit this lounge and enjoy the ambience  and the excellent  service. I can personally recommend the curator Sammuka and Mahesh for their  personal attention and service given to me on every occasion.
"My friend and I are from Las Vegas, but live in dubai. Needless to say, we know hospitality. This place was amazing from start to finish. Ranil from concierge looked after us perfectly, really made sure are stay was great. Thanks so much again. We will be back for sure and I will recommend to everyone!"
"My family and I went to Tao by Cinnamon Grand. We were served by Malinda. He’s very attentive and friendly. He makesures that our time at the restaurant was satisfying and enjoyable. He also has a vert good taste in flavours. If you have any trouble in choosing the perfect dish, leave it to Malinda. Don’t forget to meet him at Tao because he’ll make your time at Tao worth it. :)"
"Excellent food and super service by Malinda.,It was our first visit to this restaurant and the food selection and assistance was really commendable. The children enjoyed the food, it was a really good experience."
We had dinner at Echo Restaurant and we were all very impressed by the ambience and service and thoroughly enjoyed the food as well! Curator Pradeep was very friendly and helpful and made the dining experience that much better
"We came to Nuga gama for lunch and it was a great experience. The food was very tasty and the service was exceptional. ,The service I got from Ruwan, Krishmal Wasalage and Nilmini was fantastic. ,Thank you for your service. ,/Ero"
"Stay away from this dump!  This place was probably nice in the 80s. It’s a complete dive these days. The staff is rude and will try to cheat you. They over charged me and checked me out my room before my reservation, yet still charged me. The room smelled musty, and was outdated. The restaurant for breakfast in the morning had dirty plates in the tables from the previous nights dinner. Sanitation is not a priority here. Plates and silverware were generally dirty. Housekeeping rinsed out my used coffee cup and put it back like it was new and clean. I would recommend the Shangrala or any hotel built this century over this dump."
"Stanislaus was absolutely amazing with his kind service, so inviting, always smiling and lovely. I would return back to Noodles at the Cinnamon Grand just because of him! Thank you very much Stanislaus :)"
"I stayed here for 3 nights in the December, while checking in I was asked for advance cash deposit in dollars and while checking out when I was ready to pay in Sri Lankan rupees I was not given back the dollars I deposited where as while checking in I was assured I will be given back. ,Rooms are very small and needs renovation big time. Room service is also very slow, while placing an order they will also for 20 minutes and than I have e to wait for atleast 60 minutes for delivery. Housekeeping is also not done properly and while checking out you have keep waiting for the bell boy for 20 minutes to pick your luggage. The biggest problem in this hotel you call reception or housekeeping or room service they don't answer your calls promptly you have to keep waiting. Duty manger is also not helpful at all ,Overall I would rate my stay as one of the worst  hotel experience wheareas ther are other good options in Colombo pleas avoid this hotel m surely not staying in this hotel ever again."
"Very good stay  very courteous staff clean and very well managed hotel. Breakfast is amazing , good health club and ambious. Of the hotel. Also hotel is located very near to sea beach which I really enjoyed. I find value for money.,I also recommend here the staff Chamanth who  showed me Christmas bazar in hotel.,Recommended to stay Grand Cinnamon hotel,Thanks"
"After long time having Best experience of local foods (pure sti Lankan village foods) with these nice people Mr.mangala, nirosh nisal, kishmal. If you really wanna know about traditional Sri Lankan foods... this is the place,Regards,  lochana & lasantha"
"What a brilliant place for a business trip! Everyone knows this place. Quality standards are the highest, and staff training is impeccable.,Is great for business meetings - everyone readily agrees to meet you here - they probably already know the place well.,Has 14 restaurants, 3 or 4 of which are in the top 10 of Colombo.,The London Grill boasts of being the first, and still the finest, fine dining restaurant of Colombo.,Rooms are perfect for a good nights sleep. Comfortable beds, huge pillows, and quality linen.,This place sets the standard. Why go anywhere else if this falls within your budget?"
WOW what an enjoyable trip! First of all the Cinnamon Grand is a wonderful hotel where everyone of the staff make you feel very welcomed! The food is amazing I would definitely recommend visiting Tao restaurant right outside by the pool with lanterns that light the area the atmosphere is awesome and the service is terrific! Dilani and the rest of the staff gave 100% and made my time and meal the very best it could be! Highly reccomend!
Organised a dinner in honour of guests attending a high level event from South East Asian countries at the Atrium lobby. The professionalism shown by Senior Sales Manager - Banquets of the hotel was exceptional and far beyond what was expected. They went the extra mile to make the event more memorable and interesting. The food was amazing and the combination of both local and western cuisine were ideal for the invitees palate and all guests appreciated the food. The staff was quick in their service and did not hesitate to make the event flow smoothly whenever a need arose during the dinner. Would recommend the service of the banquet staff and the venues of the hotel to any official event.
"@Mangala ‘nirosh @,Superb service team. Had a good dinner out. Great Sri Lankan foods. ,Food was good and liked the toddy aswell. Good service so yeah excellent,Very good service, thank you very much!! Thanks nugagama @"
"It’s home from home staying with the CG team as I’ve stayed so many times now!  I love the hotel and all the staff.  A warm welcome on arrival from Mr Dias who always takes time to speak.  A fast and efficient check in from Natal which was great after a long journey.  The food as always is exceptional, and a big thanks to everyone at Taprabone, Lagoon and Echo.  Last but not least, Pavithra, a wonderful young lady who cleaned my room, it was so clean and she was so friendly.  The hotel is in a good location, it’s safe to walk about with shopping close by.  I’d highly recommend. "

Thankyou for the very friendly service  See you again! Another BiG thanks for beeda for my Grandmom that was very sweet of you people
One of few restaurants i revisit again and again. Again they didnt disappointment me. Love their soft Poori and their service is very friendly. More of all feel good and calm place to eat in Colombo city.  Anyone looking for a great time with good food this is the go-to-place..
"Excellent food, lovely ambience, we had such a nice time. Nirosh and all the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Highly recommended restaurant for Sri Lankan food! Love the Nuga tree in the middle which makes this place beautiful."
"I visit Sri Lanka frequently and when I am on an official business I always stay at Cinnamon Grand Colombo. This year, I stayed there five times. Each of my stay at Cinnamon was very pleasant. Staff is very helpful; services are excellent, and the food is very good."
"Great food and service at the Cinnamon Grand -Echo restaurant. Very good service and good choice of food.  Curator Pradeep offered a great service and recommendations to us.,A must visit if in Colombo."
"I must definetly start with their hospitality. Even if the food is nice you need a relaxed atmosphere to eat. Chutneys delivered them both which can be  rarely seen. The food... simply extraodinary. They had spices from kelara to the humble kulfi. ,Their interior is very soothing with neutral colours that don't hurt the eye and letters from different south indian languages on the ceiling, Simple but extraordinary..."
"Staffs were very friendly and patient. Food was perfect. We got late to go, but they were patiently treating us.we had a fantastic time. We enjoyed the atmosphere. Mr Sugeertharan was very helpful. Thank you Chutney , We enjoyed."
"Really lovely hotel, great reception/foyer staff, comfortable room.,The breakfast unfortunately went down hill after the weekend I'm afraid.  Food choice wonderful but everything was  luke- warm.   They need a better way of cooking the omelettes, poached and fried eggs maybe have some already ready , by the time they were cooked we'd almost given up. ,Also they should have dedicated staff re-setting tables, serving  the tea & coffee and filling up the food.  It took ages to get anyone to serve drinks quite disorganised I'm afraid.  There seem to be too many managers and not enough serving staff.  A shame really as everything else in the hotel, the other bars and restaurants perfect."
Really great hospitality. I thoroughly enjoyed my the food. Nice interior very soothing. The food was also served quick. Chutneys definitely has to be on the. To do list of Sri Lanka. Everything was simply great. Friendly waiters and they were thorough with their order. There was a wide range of possibilities from Kerala curries to kalkari briyani. I loved that they didn’t have a timing limit in any of the curries. The food was served hot and they had a suitable portion of food. They also have a wide range of beverages from juices to fizzy drinks. Definitely a place to visit in Sri lanka
"The room was lovely and very comfortable. Unfortunately it was difficult to get served at breakfast with tea or coffee. The coffee shop has brilliant cakes, chocolates, and ices, and at a really good price. The Breeze Bar is also very pleasant and not overpriced. The tea lounge is a must do with the fabulous Walters Bay teas. Loved the whole experience. I'd happily stay there again."
We are here in our last night after two weeks in Sri Lanka.  This restaurant is amazing with wonderful food and excellent service.  Strongly recommend the starter with prawn and onion.  No trip to Colombo is complete without eating here. A great end to our holiday
We are great to have seafood in the Lagoon.very  nice dinner. And good services by the staff! Please do visit at anytime.. best in colombo.. and in sri lanka.. Hashi spoke to us and gave a good service.
"This time also so glad to meet you Hashi.very nice always welcoming  and delighting us thankyou so much for taking care of us.that was so pleasure we really like your  comapany Hashi,Food is always excellent really enjoyed we like spicy chef made id exactly  our choice our service done by curator  Lakshan friendly guy such a wonderful  lagoon people thankyou for everything  will be back soon."
"Keshara did a great job with his team and we enjoyed the dinner a lot. It was a perfect dinner and the food he recommended was on point. ,Try to use their tab so that you can get a better idea about the food. ,Mocktails are out of this world."
Worried to step into Tao restaurant amidst the heavy rain but were eased at the the way that thy welcomed us. Specially to mention Dilani who tried her best to make every  customer happy and satisfied. Restaurant was busy and food was delayed but her warm heart made us so accomplished 
"I had a wonderful time at TAO. Food was delicious and the service i got from Dilani and Lahiru is comnendable. They definitely go for an extra mile for a customer.,Definitely a good place for a relaxed evening."
"Was looking forward to spending the last leg of cricket tour in this hotel & was not disappointed ,Rooms were clean with usual facilities you would expect from a 5 star hotel,Good comfortable bed, USB ports, square & round pin sockets,Few minus points would be standing in Bath for shower & soundproofing not 100% between rooms,Very impressive comfortable lobby walk through areas.,Numerous dining options which will satisfy all tastes,Great laundry service (a little dearer than other hotels but well worth it),Good Pool,Hard to fault service & friendliness of staff.,On next cricket tour would look to return here!!"
"Although I rarely visit the restaurants at The Cinnamon Grand Colombo.I often grab a quick snack from The Cofee Stop.,The food here is affordable.My favorites include the Tandoori Chicken Puff and Wrap and the Danish Tart.The main reason I frequent The Cofee Stop so often,is that the staff are so welcoming. I have to mention that Mr Delucian,Mr Karan,Mr Sanka,Chaminda and Kasun are especially friendly.,Unlike most restaurants the staff here do not hesitate to have long chats with you.,I highly recommend a trip to The Cofee Stop if you want to have something delicious or just want to talk to a friend ."
"I visited lagoon fish restraurant in Cineman grand under company Keels last week for dinner with my wife and daughter with her husband ,We had meals and I ordered a pint of lager ,When the bill came they have charged over double for.the beer and bill shows that they charged for a pitcher of beer,I complained to the waiter annd and they took my card and recharged again with a lesser value ,I get text from HSBC credit card that I have been charged twice,Manager gave me a void note from the machine,I called the credit card company and still they have not fully taken out one of the double payment ,One week  Since  it happened hotel manager did not revert back with information about full cancellation except the a call next day given by me by him,I keep calling the credit card company paying for calls several times and I am told to wait until end of the month to check bill ,All the travellers should be weary of payment by credit cards as some hotels keep charging with no control ,Fish was good but the billing process was “fishy”"
"Efficient check-in / check-out.  Staff friendly and helpful.  From doorman to housekeeping.  Great selection of restaurants and good food.  Next to shopping centre, which has a supermarket and food-court.  Rooms a bit dated but clean.  Air-con not so efficient.  Lifts a bit slow.  Breakfast has a fantastic selection of local and western.  Need to walk out to main road to get tuk-tuk.  Had a great massage at the spa.  Good wi-fi connection."
"We stayed here at this stunning hotel for a night before our flight back from Colombo to London. This really is a superb, luxury hotel in the middle of Colombo CBD and provides an excellent base to explore Colombo.,The 'Cheers Pub' is a great bar in the hotel for a beer / watching sport and generally chilling out. ,We had breakfast in the hotel which was fantastic!,The rooms in the hotel are absolutely superb, spacious and extremely comfy. My only real regret is that we didn't / couldn't stay here for longer. Should I go back to Colombo and spend longer there, I would have absolutely no hesitation in staying at this hotel again :),We also used the hotels airport shuttle service which was excellent value.,Thank you for a superb stay."
"It was my maybe the 7th visit where I bring my international friends to introduce them Sri Lankan cuisine. ,We love the buffet and the friendly service of the staff from entrance to exist. Specially mr Dhammika who was earlier and Mr Mangala who served us. "
"At the Tao restaurant here at Cinnamon Grand Hotel, my dining experience was wonderful, due to the excellent and authentic cuisine, and the attentiveness of Dilani. She suggested several signature dishes and soups, and the suggestions were absolutely great. The Peking Duck was sliced tableside and wrapped by Dilani and the attending chef. Such a great meal and experience! I recommend it highly!"
"A lovely hotel buzzing with life. A beautiful lobby with a lovely bar (although slow service). Nice big rooms (no sea view), amazing food in the restaurants- a lovely breakfast spread at the coffee shop and an amazing Srilankan food spread under a banyan tree in the open. At very reasonable rates- located close to the beach with a small shopping arcade attached."
"This is a very big grand hotel just 1 block away from the bay. Efficient reception and very helpful staff. Options for dining are good and we had a formal dinner with superb food.,Comfortable rooms though I spent little time there after suffering the Sri Lankan traffic from Kandy.,Not cheap and too big to be personal, but very comfortable"
"At Cinnamon Grand, the open hall is uncommon and beautiful. Its extra high ceiling and innovative décor is perfect. ,Nice and clean tables. ,Food is awesome. ,But unfortunately service is not as expected. "
"We had a wonderful time on Sunday with my family.we came for Malu Malu Buffet very nice spread.good varieties all Sri Lankan food.there are some dishes for kids as well grilled item corner very nice fresh and so crispy.,Hashi mainly focus our table since we came with kids she has given a great hospitality service.very nice girl ready to help thankyou Hashi for giving us comfortable time and great time."

"Visiting from India; this is the second time we (with son and family) are visiting Nuga Gama during our visit to Srilanka in 2 weeks. Your staff, especially Mr. Mangala, are exceptionally nice and their hospitality is excellent. Food is authentic Srilankan and the ambience of the restaurant is strikingly natural. Surrounded by large trees and straw huts,one would not believe that such a lovely, rural looking place existed at a 5 star hotel. Strongly recommended for anyone wanting have a memorable dining experience with their near and dear ones."
"Good Sri lankan food spread with authentic teast. Sri lankan hospitality and care from Mansala, Nishan, Wasalage and krishmal. Keep up the good work pls make sure the same Sri Lankans hospitality given to all the customers visit to Nuga Gama."
"Great service at the Nuga Gama restaurant this evening, Mangala was a pleasure to talk to and bought an authentic experience to life. All the staff made the experience enjoyable and all food is served was to an extremely high standard. ,Worth a visit when in Sri Lanka even if not staying at the cinnamon grand"

The staff was really great, great service, food was delicious. Most of all the ambiance was just amazing and we loved it. They also surprised my mum with a little cake. I am so glad that I choose the right place. It was indeed an unforgettable day."

Silent rooms, comfortable beds, very nice decorated rooms with all I needed to hand. The hotel has around 14 restaurants and food is amazing here. I had the chance to meet an employee called Prince who toured me around the hotel so I could take some pictures for my blog and I absolutely enjoyed discovering the hotel with such a nice local employee, very educated, polite and over all very professional.

Came here the day we arrived to Colombo after not eating all day and we were not disappointed! The pork spring rolls were amazing for appetizers and the service is impeccable! Lovely cocktails too. Our servers (Malinda & Lahiru) were so friendly and helpful. The surroundings are amazing definitely worth a visit to the Grand Cinnamon just for Tao Restaurant.
