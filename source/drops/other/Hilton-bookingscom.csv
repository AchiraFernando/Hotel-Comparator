"Very nice hotel, donâ€™t miss the chance to stay there. We like everything. Very good stuff. "
Only we donâ€™t like that the swimming pool is far from the hotel but this is not very important. 
"The restaurants at the Hilton are superb. excellent buffets and menu. The Curry Leaf provides a delicious variety of Sri Lankan foods, the breakfast and dinner buffet in ain restaurant was amazing... something for everyone. Also, the Tika Marsal pizza is the best!"
"Staff are fantastic - couldnâ€™t do enough for us.A great place to stay with young children."
Room / upper level decor is a bit tired but the communal spaces make up for it
"Everything. The staff are courteous  andhelpful . The restaurant are excellent,  food delicious  and good value. Room  and bed comfortable.  And a good location  too.just a short walk to the boardwalk
"
Location 
It seems a little dated. I had to wait a long time for my room. After expressing my disappointment I was upgraded and moved to my room efficiently.
"The stay at Hilton Colombo was a wonderful experience. I was worried whether I could meet a driver of limousine service because the arrival of the plane was delayed. But I was worried about wastefulness.Driver's driving was very careful and trustable. The car is a Mercedes' G class, and its car is not as luxurious, but as it was equipped enough, I enjoyed  move with relax.In front of the late night the hotel reception quickly took the check-in procedure. I think that New York Hilton should follow this quick check-in. The room is clean. The washroom and the bathtub were also thoroughly cleaned, and there was no hair left.Bed is also good. However, it is inferior to the Westin bed.The breakfast buffet was fantastic. In addition to American breakfast, I enjoyed Sri Lankan, Indian and Chinese cuisine. Of course, as well as cooking, tea is also wonderful. There was a courtyard before the dining and we could see the black birds. A wonderful experience. It was winter, so it was not hot though I ate on the terrace.Many staff are very kind and never been kept waiting, checkout was so quick."
"nothing special.There were a lot of construction around the hotel, the road was rough, so I could not enjoy jogging.There are many crowds of expensive taxis around the hotel."
Location was good .Front desk was helpful
Bathroom water  drainage was very bad.water clogged up to the knees .Nothing was done yo fix it. Did not meet expectations to the other Hilton properties we have used before. Not likely to recommend to friends and family
"Everything about Hiton spells welcome. From the ever-smiling, helpful staff and security personnel to the food outlets that cater to every taste. Checking-in was as smooth as it gets (just 5 minutes). The expansive room we had overlooked the sea (ask for it early) and the service was prompt. The hotel is located in the heart of the city, a stonÃ©'s throw from the World Trade Centre and the Dutch quarters where the you will find the Ministry of Crabs which has been rated among the top 25 best restaurants in Asia. If it is lunch, it must be here. Miss anything else, but not lunching or dining here. Yes, they serve only crabs, but only the very best catch. Be warned: you need to book weeks in advance. If you are the gambling kind, the two casinos nearby will take you and bring you back to the hotel (never mind what time of the day or night) in right royal style. And the ride is on the house. Beat that! Go ahead, try your hand and be a king (or queen) for the day (or night). Good luck with the cards. Pssst... know when to fold them, and know when to run!"
"The foul smell emanting from the river that flows behind the hotel's large pool (where you can cuddle up with a book, or sip on a martini on any one of the bed-like enclosures). Nothing the hotel can do about the smell. Pity. But it does act as a dampner."
"The room was really clean and comfortable, the customer service and airport transfers great, and the breakfast buffet and cafÃ© also really good."
"The only thing I could say is that the dÃ©cor was a bit dated, but everything was clean and functioned well."
"staff were excellent, as good or better than anywhere I have stayed previously. enjoyed the location, easy walking distance to bars and dining."
bathroom and bedroom were outdated.
"Everything about this place is amazing 
Staff was so great , food is the best too .. we love coming here 
There was these two little helpers at the graze kitty made us feel like home one of them is Heshan who was a waiter there, and the other one from the lobby bar.. see you next year ðŸ˜Š"
"The location is great and the staff are pretty kind. The management is generous with far exceeding breakfast expectaion in all of Srilanka, which compensated for the hotel age..."
Breakfast
The buffet was amazing! The view of the room too.
The room was dirty for the price.... i was so sad of it... you should choose another place if you want a really good room.
The breakfast Spread was amazing. The staff was extremely courteous. We were served by Deshan from Grace Kitchen on all the three days and he was the best.
The rooms are very old.
The food was the best part and was so amazing. The staff was professional and very very friendly (the house keeper leaving a hand written note was a nice personal touch)
The value for money was lacking. The room was a bit dated -needs renewal
Large room with a very comfortable bed. Nice views of the city. Staff very friendly. Refurbishment of the lobby and bar area looks fantastic with live music most nights. Mostly business guests however we have stayed here twice and love the Curryleaf Restaurant. Food in the main restaurant  also very good and the breakfast buffet ranks up there with the best we've ever had in a hotel. Good location to get to the cricket stadium which was the main focus of our stay. Will be back!! 
Room was a bit tired. Didn't like the location of the shops as they have moved since the last time we visited.
"loved the location, loved the view for the sea from my bed, hospitality and service were outstanding"
Food was good but could have been better in terms of diversity and spread.
Their hospitality and service quality is fantastic  
Their room service was awesome but they should provide shaving kits regularly before guest asking for that and brash kits should including paste. Shoe shiner can be also provided. As a five star hotel they should have SPA
Location 
"Old hotel and rooms are outdated, newer 5 star hotels in the same area with same price.choose Hilton only if you think it is cheap as the rooms are too old and other facilities such as swimming and the gym are quite far from the hotel."
"The staff were very courteous and friendly.Large roomSmoking rooms were available"
"Other than the face and bath towels provided, it would have been better to have small hand towels provided as well"
"It felt good when we walked in at 1am from our flight. Very impressive entry.
Breakfast was excellent.
Room very comfortable as always with Hilton Hotels.
Staff at reception very good"
Nothing.
"Staff were excellent. Loved the breakfast, the swan lake and the simplistic design of villas"
"Hotel room and hallway does not smell fresh and luxurious like Hiltons worldwide. Cheap choice of lavender diffuser kept in hallway. Old towels and robes, outdated picture frame and tired sofa did not do justice. Looked like the hotel needed a face lift"
Location is excellent and the staff service is really good. They have a great breakfast too.
"Upon check in, I noticed the water from the bathtub was brown for about 15-20 seconds. I called the reception to send their Engineers to check and they promptly attend to it. I wasnâ€™t feeling uncomfortable initially when I saw the brown water"
The room was big very comfortable and we had a room with view of lake and sea.  The buffet breakfast was great but staff could be a bit more attentive to guests.
"Staff who had been serving for over 25 years ,Struggling to Keep up the Hilton name even with the deteriorating hotel standards."
Whole place is too old and standards are deteriorating. It is pathetic to see how management is ruining the Srilankan tax payers money.Attending to  what is not required for convenience of the guest.o
The waiters and receptionists are very friendly. And the foods were delicious.
"Since I checked in the Hotel with my partner, the hotel kept only one tooth brush and the some attendees brought towels while we were inside the room. And the room doesn't seems vaccuumed in days. The toilet floor was wet all the time. The guy control the elevator from the ground floor seems a guard at the prison moving without any smile."
The basic problem is that the hotel has refurbished its lobby but the rooms are still from the 1980s. The lobby could be of any 5 star hotels the rooms are not.
Rooms. Peeling edges . Plastic curtains in the bath. Cheap air freshener smell. basically one can get better value for the price.
The service at the restaurants is absolutely fabulous! Great views from the room.
"The rooms are really old and badly need a refurbishment, and the air conditioning (even after we got it repaired) wasnt working. The housekeeping staff starts knocking at 10AM to clean your room, and woke us up on both days!"
"Nice breakfast with a big variety and healthy choices. 
Very good staff and level of service. 
"
"Old rooms, run down and in need for renovation. Mold in the bathroom. 
Room access system doesnâ€™t work well and had to go to reception evwry time with my key to reactivate so that i can get in my room. Gym is tiny and feels crowded   "
Not to the expected standard..  Did not have any like in.. will not consider Hilton anymore if this continues. With all my last three visits I have been n Hilton and you may check. Been a Sri Lankan got my guest to stay.. but even my partners are not happy with the service levels
"Attitude of the reception and the services rendered. Room allocation was not either satisfied.  One allocated room did not have A/C, requested king size beds from the reception but again there were two single beds.. Reception was not friendly all.. it's like your choice to use Hilton or find else where."
Food was good
"1. Train ticket arrangement was not possible, even before confirmed as possible by TEL.2. Facility was poor, Bathtub was damaged, after changed room still function was not enough."
"The hotel dining.   We ordered a meat pies each.    When trying to eat it it wasApparent it was badly burnt within and the pastry was impossible to eat.We complained to the maÃ®tre d, who hastily removed the evidence, broughtA plate of cut up fruit to compensate.    We were expecting a refund on thisDreadful burnt offering.   If you think this was satisfactory, then the hotel does noDeserve it,s rating.    What a disgrace.   Having spent quite enough on the 5 Days stay, thankfully Sri Lanka has some excellent hotels to choose from.As airline employees, we have stayed at the best worldwide, but we intend toWarn others to avoid your Hilton.Sincerely, Frank Irons, Queensland, Australia."
Actually everything is better room bed location  reception staff room service as well
I donâ€™t like one of security person in the lobby neat way to goin to car park he doesnâ€™t know respect the customer
The breakfast was excellent.
"I don't know if it was just our floor or the entire hotel, but the bathrooms belong to the 80's. Budget hotels have better bathrooms these days. The final bill was almost 30% more than the one advertised on Booking.com"
"Breakfast was good.Concierge staff helpful.All staff were very friendly."
"The walls, carpets, curtains and bathroom suite were all dirty and stained. A lot of the furniture was battered, bruised and scratched. Had we been staying in the hotel longer than the 15 hours we were, we would have requested a room change. On check-out we informed the reception that we were not happy with the room because of the matters described. The told us that the rooms had not been renovated for some years, but were due to be done soon. As a result the room was not worth the price that we were charged for it."
"Nice location close to some shoping and bar's Good food in buffe resturant."
"No information binder in the room about hotel facilitys and city.Pool area is nothing to have.Curry leafe resturant is not wort to visit ."
Breakfast was ok
Wi-fi ask for the immediate connection.. Business center should be looked after by a person and need to have the required customer standard.
Hilton always a good choice! Good location! Friendly Helpful Staff
"Hilton Colombo renovated lobby and restaurant area but forgot renovation for guest rooms!!!!Old build in Furniture old Bathroom"
"Curry leaf restaurant was awesome!Thanks to Housekeeping Team. thanks to Kasun, HK staff for  the service and Mr. Sumit, HK Manager.Polite and friendly Front office staff."
Great location very close to Dutch Hospital. Great lobby. Superb iced coffee in lobby.
Room was clean but very dated. Sound proofing of room is poor - easy to hear noise from corridor and other bathrooms. Pool location is odd - a long walk from the hotel.
"Location is good.Nice dinner and breakfast buffet."
"During check in no information about hotel and there is no info binder in room so we hade to spend some time finding restaurants and there opening times. Pool area is not much to have and some walk from hotel.  Room is old and tear and were after many years is use, bathroom was fare away from clean fat and hair from previous gest in bath tube."
good location . Lobby is fancy .
"1. I was seated by restaurant reception for breakfast on the table which was booked by group, I didn't know and the group people was so angry because i sat there and asked to leave table . worst experience in 5 star hotels .2.  I ordered one bottle of wine from bar previous night , and i brought the wine to bar next day , the waiter told me  I can't drink here because i didn't order from hotel even i kept told him i ordered from bar last night .3. room service people knocked wrong door in midnight . although they upgrade my room ,but overall , they need improve their service badly ."
We absolutely had a good time. Staff were friendly and helpful. Just want to add Zoysa at the restaurant went the extra mile to make sure our little girl was comfortable at breakfast .
"Eventhough the carpet in the room needs updating, it was very clean."
"A 5 starts with good social areas, but rooms and specialy (very small) bathrooms badly in need of refurbishing.Be careful with prices shown by Booking.com. They don t includ taxes, that will bring your bill up by 30+ %"
Hidden costs. Tired rooms with small bathrooms.
"Very good location, nice n clean rooms - bath. Comfortable stay. It seemed little overpriced though."
"Very poorly managed check in and check out at the reception. Hotel wrongly overcharged me and I had to take lot of effort to get that settled.
Wish a complimentary breakfast was offered, (like any other hotel,) which was not the case."
Great room with a great view. Staff was very attentive. Beautiful decorations and setup at the hotel bar and restaurant. Impressive design in general.
"The AC in the lobby, the hallways and the room was very strong and even after turning the AC off in the room it was still very cold. Also the smell of cloves (air freshener) outside our room was very intense. For the bathroom, it would have been better if the shower head was not fixed on the wall."
Xmas spirit good and had excellent food
No information about hotel facilities  or services in room nor about tours etc and hotel not helpful with transport other than their own cars at over two/ three times the price.
Excellent breakfast.
"1. I stayed at the hotel twice within the same month. Although I was on an executive floor, I was not told about the facilities available for me at the executive lounge when I checked in, e.g. happy hour. A very helpful staff member called Krishnajina told me about this much later during my 2nd stay at the hotel.2. The gym is too far away."
Poor fittings...>Toilet was licking. Ahead of the Christmas ambiance was awesome...however stuff are not smiling enough compared to many similar places.
Not the best customer service
The hotel had a good selection of restaurants on the property.
waited over an hour for the room. My request was to have 2 rooms on the same floor but was given rooms on different floors. Had to catch an early flight so we could not have breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast packs provided contained very few items for 2 and not 4 persons and was not reflective of the amount i paid. The bathrooms requires an urgent revamp.
Perfect location if you want somewhere close to the train station.  We used this Hotel as a final night stopover before travelling to the airport the following morning.  Did not use the pool but it looked good.  WiFi excellent.
A little on the pricey side
Staff at the restaurant at breakfast were excellent!!
"1. Although I was on an executive floor, I was not told about the facilities available for me at the executive lounge when I checked in, e.g. happy hour. A very helpful staff member called Krishnajina told me about this during my 2nd stay.2. The gym is too far away."
"1. Comfort big bed2. Complied to star rating of hotel3. Good variety of choices for breakfast buffet"
"1. No shelter walkway to the facilities (clubhouse, gym, swimming pool)"
"Friendly and helpful staff, the clean comfortable room and the view of the ocean!"
