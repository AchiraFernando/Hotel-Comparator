"Staff was very friendly, superb hotel for a vacation"
"Amazing hotel, great location. Buffet breakfast was very good with lots of dietary options!"
The staff were friendly and helpful. The horizon lounge was brilliant and the views were excellent.
Everything about the hotel and hospitality is very good.
Staff very friendly. Very clean room. Excellent breakfast buffet
"Everything was amazing! There was not one thing we could fault, amazing room, lovely friendly staff, the girls from the guest experience team are fantastic and the most incredible brekky. We’ll be back!"
Hotel was amazing nothing to fault. Really enjoyed our family stay there. Highly recommended.
"Breakfast was awesome! We had the chef cook us fresh currys both days which was the best curry we had all trip. The rooms were comfy, pool was nice. Had a great stay."
"Very luxurious and clean, food options were good, Buffet was very tasty but above all generally friendly and attentive service at a high level."
I did not like the fact that the hotel encouraged us to use the Shangri La car service which is of course way more expensive than regular taxi’s.
"I also didn’t like how one waiter tried to get me to sign up for a loyalty card while I was enjoying drinks with my friend. The location is ok but nothing special, a lot of industrial building going on."
Airport transfer service is priced well above average and more in line with places like London or Paris
The beauty salon was a bit small for the hotel size. but not a big deal. the treatment was nice.
I was here for the Ironman tri and it was so good to have the hotel right near the course. Everyone was so helpful and friendly. And this has to be one of the best breakfast buffets I've ever had!!
Pool service was slow and needs more attention.The pool was too cold.
exceptional service (they gave us a late checkout free of charge..!)
Outstanding experience. Table One (for breakfast) and Kaemasutra are both excellent restaurants
I liked everything in this hotel. They cleaned our room twice per day and the room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent with a big variety of local and international choices. The staff was extremely professional.
Very helpful and friendly staff. Great Location
The rooms are luxurious and a lot of attention to detail has been given. Food is great at all the restaurants. very well located
ONE COMPLAINT THE FISH & CHIPS I ORDERED FOR DINNER THROUGH IN ROOM DINING WAS VERY OILY . OTHERWISE LOVELY EXPERIENCE WILL BE BACK .
"It was our honeymoon, they welcomed us with goodies and wine in the room. Staff was courteous throughout. Amazing views from the comfortable room. A great city experience"
The person who checked me in provided an excellent service. This is the reason for why I booked another stay at the same hotel.
"Beautiful hotel, would recommend staying especially after a long journey. Relaxing, friendly staff, clean rooms. Would return again"
Facilities were luxurious; the staff would help you with almost anything; in-room dining was surprisingly cheep and was very good.
The lobby restaurant manager made us feel unwelcome by asking us not to play the piano
Bathroom was a bit disappointing !
One of the best breakfast buffets ever. Overall very good stay. Nice new hotel. Will be convenient when their big mall next door will be finished in 2020.
Great stay in Shangri La Staff is helpful
Quite expensive but really worth it. Food is really nice and varied. Location is great. View is incredible.
Staff were so friendly Rooms beautiful Food very good
"The quality, service, experienced staff, Horizon floor services"
Oasis in the middle of Colombo. Very friendly staff. Great restaurants.
"Really nice and modern hotel, cozy atmosphere of Christmas. Though service in Capitol Grill restaurant was not the best, the bar was really nice with great cocktails from barman. Fabulous selection for breakfast and lunch, amazing dinner in Chinese restaurant."
The service in Capitol Grill & Lobby lounge was quite slow and not attentive.
Absolutely amazing Buffet incredible Facilities great The best hotel I’ve ever stayed at
"Nimesha was great, actually wanted to thank her for her introduction of the property and showing us around. It would be great if I can thank her in person"
"The room, the property, the staff , the pool - everything was fantastic. The property is absolutely stunning and the staff are the friendliest and most helpful of any property I have stayed at."
Friendly staff.. good food.. excellent service
That there was no pool table for all day use.
"No bed turn down service, fruit bowl not delivered until second day, no little extras in the room"
"Luxe cocktail bar, good music, good bar service, comfy bed, staff on club floor superb printed boarding passes, welcomed our guests to the lounge, food choices on club floor comprehensive & well replenished, pool area well maintained very comfortable staff very attentive. Staff member in lobby (Radika) thoughtfully enquired about our plan for the day and engaged hotel tuk tuk without us having to ask or get lost or feel unsure as this was our first day and first time in Colombo we were very appreciative."
Friendliness of staff and quality of service culture
Nice view over Colombo and indien ocean and fantastique business lounge for extra cost but worth it.
Rooms are not spacious and is only good for one person. Restauraunts are over pricing all items
Room size and cost
Lovely stay; excellent staff and great facilities. We staid 2 days and haven't left the property. Great location for as a family. The kids enjoyed the pool and we loved all the different restaurants.
Front office & concierge will not pick Up phone when the hotel is closed to full house. Wonder if they are under staffed.
All the staff from arrival to hotel & leaving ( check out) . I would like to recommend to others to stay. 
"Reception staff & manager so kind give on wife birthday bottle of wine, cake & fruits. My children was so happy."
"Modern, Classy, super finish throughout, stylish, comfortable, best hotel in Srilanka"
A few of the fixtures in the bathroom didn’t work but this was a minor issue compared to the whole experience and compared to the other frankly substandard 5 star hotels in Srilanka
"good location ,clean and comfortable place."
breakfast is good but if you order omlet or hoppers you will not get it on time.We left waiting for an hour with out getting it.
Very new and authentic place
"I stayed on the 30th floor with acces to the club lounge.The club lounge located on the 32nd floor is beautifull.Very friendly staff especially the door man.Also great was the breakfast in the all day dining;Beautifull set up, nice live stations and the best string hoppers with coconut sambal"
The hotel has a good variety of restaurants food is delicious and service is excellent. Spa was very nice and i enjoyed the facilties too.
"Service, food, cocktails, room, pool..everything was exceptional."
The sheer range of the breakfast buffet and quality of the food. Great local and international selection.
"The ocean view was pretty average, that is mostly due to the construction work happening in the area so not really a modifiable factor."
The staff were so helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast was excellent value and the food delicious. The room was very well appointed and we had an excellent view.
We very much pay attention to detail and this was excellent quality
"In general, everything met or exceeded expectations. Staff were friendly and helpful, room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast buffet was superb."
"The food is amazing! Lovely comfortable and clean rooms, great spa/pool/gym."
"A lot of staff with not much to do, feels like they are bored. And as a consequence a lot of annoying chit chat conversations that get started by the staff."
Great hotel to stay for business and a valuable addition to the Colombo hotel landscape.
"The food and the staff were amazing, they really make you feel like you're the only guests there! Lovely pool. Views from the room were great."
"Staff very polite and helpful Fantastic bar and lobby with great views and ambience Lovely pool,gym"
Everything . If your looking for a special place to stay this as to be the best. The whole experience was ausum and the staff are highly experienced . Another exceptional stay at the Shangri-la.

"Expected it to be sea view but was harbour view, Kitchenette was little small. Little more reasonable pricing"
 Pool was good but a little bit cold
Excellent location. Beautiful hotel with really friendly staff. The free tuk tuk is great too.
The staff were super attentive and friendly - especially at the door and in the restaurant.
The two bedroom apartment was fantastic. Staff were great and facilities amazing. Great location too.
Everything was excellent and the service was beyond my expectations.
The swimming pool should be bigger.
"Welcoming and friendly staff, the rooms are spacious and very clean with new furniture compared to other 5 star hotels in Colombo. The hotel offers different dining options such as Chinese, Steakhouse and international buffet."
"Great room with seaview. Friendly and helpful staff. Good and clean facilities - well equipped gym, pool, steambath, jacuzzi etc."
Staff are really friendly and always there to help you . I would say great service.
Very nice property and very helpful staff. The tea time is very special. Highly reccomended
One of the best breakfast buffets I've ever had. Super service throughout our stay.
The construction site in front of it but understand it needs to happen
" Prestige interior design, great food, outstanding service"
Don't think Value for money .Staff especially at restaurant need more training and food are not that great. very much business orientated. In Srilanka there are much better hotels deliver better customer service and value for money
"Overall, it was a very pleasant stay. The breakfast experience could be improved. I was told that the hotel was running at 80% occupancy, and the single person cooking hoppers could not cope with the high demand. I suggest having two or three hopper stations especially during the peak breakfast hours. Everything else was excellent."
First class service and excellent location.
attitude of the staff is not impressive
Very busy and staff is not able to cater to individuals needs on time. Poor performance by kitchen and lobby staff. No welcome drinks or towels. We travelled 300km to get here and didnt get a welcome feeling like other hotels we visited
No value for money. Allocation of room was hopeless as the room had to be changed thrice just for one night's stay.
"Staff poor at communicating. Restaurants very poor and reservations hard to do with reception. Toilet lights did not work, air con was very noisy and did not work well. Bad soundproofing. Overall poor experience and very poor value for money."
The location was fantastic.
"Terrible room service, front desk staff. Room service got our order wrong. Took three calls for housekeeping to respond. We checked in at 5am, they charged us for 2 nights, fine. But then they called us at 2am the next morning to see if we’d checked out!!! Night manager should be fired. A lame I’m sorry was not sufficient for ruining our stay. Would not recommend."
