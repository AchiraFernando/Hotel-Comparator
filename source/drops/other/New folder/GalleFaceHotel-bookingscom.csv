Amazing place with lovely and helpful staff. Great food. Lovely pool area
Intolerable noise from outside. I am afraid I got a room in the “bad” part of the hotel
Huge room and you can hear the waves when you open the windows. Great breakfast and iconic sunset
"The hotel is a bit tired and our room looked like t hadn’t been used in a while. The staff was very quick in fixing it, but We let we had better experience in significantly cheaper places."
"Great hotel staff, pool bar food and drinks on the top level, complimentary snacks and softs in the room, great atmosphere."
The room was great the staff was friendly and professional. We had high tea with invited friends rather than dinner which was fantastic.
Staff are great. Location is excellent. Loved the breakfast and pool.
"Nice, big hotel with history. Beautiful terrace to enjoy a drink. Breakfast was vast and lovely. Nice pool overlooking the ocean."
Our room was okay but not as beautiful as where we stayed before here.
Breakfast on Veranda lovely. Hotel was historic and elegant.
"An exceptional colonial hotel with up to the second amenities. Wonderful staff providing excellent service. Great choice of food and drinks, a truly fantastic place to stay in Sri Lanka."
Everything about this beautiful hotel is perfect. The staff are wonderful. The breakfast is superb and the atmosphere/buildings are excellent. I will always return here when I come back to Colombo!
The location right on the water is stunning. It was lovely to sit by the pool and overlook the ocean and have the waves crashing right there. It doesn't get much more beautiful than this. It is also very close to any restaurant or site you want to visit in Colombo. The buffet breakfast was also quite delicious. The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.
Great service and facilities
The outstanding service provided by the hotel personnel
A room with a balcony would have been nice but overall good
The hotel was everything i expected. I was there for the Ironman race and i was welcomed the minute i stepped in the door despite turning up with my bike and all my kit. The rooms are great. The hotel is steeped in history and this is reflected in every aspect of the place. I would highly recommend it when you are in Colombo. I fell asleep to the sound of the sea!!
Lovely old colonial building adjacent to the sea with pleasant and helpful staff. Great facilities.
A little pricey for Sri Lanka and what it offers
"Location, swimming pool, atmospheric old colonial hotel, with a wonderful museum over the history of the hotel. The sunset, the lowering of the Sri Lankan flag at sunset."
Beautiful colonial style hotel with a lot of charme. Excellent location
Beautiful hotel and friendly staff
"Beautiful old colonial hotels. Great facilities, lovely big pool. Nice pool bar and Cuban restaurant. Drinks quite pricey compared to other hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka. Huge bedroom."
Silly light system all controlled from a key pad that you can’t see in the night! Difficult to find a light switch to actually turn on! Air con was also difficult to use and so our room hot overnight.
"The ambience of the historic past, the building, the rooms, the location - all great"
"There was a fantastic welcome as we arrived in the morning the staff went out of their way to get our room ready earlier so we didn't have to wait until check in. Everyone was very friendly and provided fantastic customer service, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for making the start of my holiday in Sri Lanka one to remember."
" In the check-in, the staff in the front desk assigned me a room which is less than what I paid for."
On the ocean front Location. Friendly & helpful staff. Caring management.
"Room was on 4th floor in one corner facing a tower with a soldier with weapon. It was big but old, bathroom had a leak. Old room old aisle."
The lemongrass smell in lobby. Fantastic upgrade to emperor suite. Extremely comfortable bed . Great staff all over hotel
Fantastic historic hotel. First class accommodation. Pillows / bed great. View of property & ocean sensational. Breakfast buffet very nice. Staff plentiful. Pool excellent. Cheap tuk tuk to markets or shops in Colombo.
On the seafront but unable to swim in the sea. Very efficient and friendly staff. Ok location. Access to many local hotel restaurants. Complementary soft drinks and snacksin the room fridge. Hotel Cuban bar lively with good cocktails. 30m swimming pool with salt water. Spa and gym facilities good.
"No view from our room. Lots of building projects nearby, but this did not affect our hotel stay."
"Colonial grandeur - a delight to stay in this beautiful heritage building with such a rich history. Gin and tonic on the beachfront, a swim in the pool and a Sri Lankan curry buffet for dinner. Heaven! I never opened a door the whole time I stayed there. Staff were very attentive and friendly."
Great style and fantastic service
"The staff were great, nothing was a problem. The breakfast is fantastic. The pool is clean and amazing spot for watching the sunset"
"A historical and traditional hotel, beautiful place and wondelful property. The renovation is made very well, they have not destroyed the feeling of the palace. The room was big and well equipped. The staff is professional. We got very good dinners in the special restaurants and the selection of wines is huge."
"We had to wait more than half an hour before we got the room even that we arrived after 2 in the afternoon. They just forgot us sitting on the sofa. The buffetrestaurant is too big and restless, it was not nice to have at least breakfast there."
Love the location by the sea. Friendly staff. Amazing breakfast buffet. Great massage at the spa.
Was offered a rubbish room with noisy road outside. I was upgraded after a little time so it worked out ok in the end.
"We came in late desk duty were very curtious and efficient, bell staff were the same and then on top of that we were upgraded to a sea view suite wonderful way to wake up in the morning. Thankyou"
Comfortable hotel. Great staff. Wonderful service. Would return
Old colonial style atmosphere. Bedroom comfortable and beautiful.
No view whatsoever from bedroom. Slow service in bar area during lunch time. Quality of food served during the various buffet services and the seating ambiance of the restaurant could be much better.
Despite being a large hotel the staff still make it feel very friendly. The fact that the hotel has its own seafront and has retained its sense of its history makes it feel quite special. The hotel catering was excellent.
"The best hotel in Colombo, and probably in all Sri Lanka Colonial atmosphere, perfect service, and excellent breakfast"
Cost much more than the alternatives
The meals and drinks menu is not clear about tax not being included so final bill almost doubles.
Right on the sea front. The building holds so many historical features and it is beautiful
Very traditional hotel with many famous guests
Reception exceptionally busy (a bit of a wait time) and beds a bit too soft for me.
"Taxes are not included in the room rate or any of the menus, when booking this should be clearer as was much more expensive than advertised."
Property itself was beautiful and the staff very nice
"The location is great, easy to walk to the old Dutch hospital development, or the shops at Crescat. A short tuk tuk ride to Barefoot, Paradise Rd and The Gallery Cafe."
"it’s a beautiful old hotel and fun. With lots of friendly efficient staff. Chanaka on reception particularly helpful. I needed him to print a contract, to sign and then them to scan it back to me... which they did without fuss and very quickly "
"Nothing.. it’s a beautiful old hotel and fun. With lots of friendly efficient staff. Chanaka on reception particularly helpful. I needed him to print a contract, to sign and then them to scan it back to me... which they did without fuss and very quickly"
"A wonderful historical experience. Charming and elegant. The real Surprise was the King of Mambo downstairs and outside on the lawn. It is a must for any visitor. great atmosphere, food and setting, and lounges."
Good hotel for our short stay in Colombo. Great location as very close to local Laksalas for shopping and to other tourist spots.
Room was not well-lit
Great location and colonial vibe
Food at beach bar was very average. Chicken satay served undercooked and slightly pink. Staff very helpful and ordered again but still under cooked.
The considerate staff
We would like to thank the hotel staff for being so accommodating and friendly. Loved the location as well.
Noisy after midnight with music
"additional telephone for bigger rooms and I have to run to answer the phone. If I was sleeping, I cannot go back to sleep coz I had to answer the door or the phone by the time I go back to bed I am awake! Need Chargers at the bar! Sound system improvement and spa needs improvement"
" Location, historic building and staff"
It’s got great character and the restaurant is very good with good variety of evening meals. Breakfast was ok. Staff are fantastic. Beds are very comfy. Great location to go walking and exploring. Plenty of tuktuks outside if you want to go anywhere.
It’s an old building so you can hear people moving around on the floor above which can wake you up. Room smelt a little musty or damp but nothing major.
"Beautiful historic building. Wonderful dining. Buffet at breakfast was a great variety and huge buffet. English, Sri Lankan and to order eggs any style. Nice drink selection and pool. Wonderful place to recover during an extended journey."
Our room was noisy from a wedding below us. (They moved us immediately no problem. Very service oriented).
The staff were very kind to us when we arrived very early in the morning after a long flight and found us a room to occupy by mid morning at no extra cost.
Charming elegant place to stay
Everything. It’s a lovely colonial style hotel. With seniority and elegance. The Cuban bar is great. I will definitely repeat if I go back to Colombo.
everything was great
"We believe that the superior room we had needs refurbishing, it is quite worn out for a 5 star superior room"
Traditional hotel. High standard as you'd expect. Lovely facilities and spacious rooms
The complementary free mini bar which consisted on a packet of nuts and teabags in a fridge. The hotel is tired and over priced
Nice grounds and beautiful old building. In general staff extremely nice. Buffet breakfast and lunch were very good.
"The room was very small and bathroom doors had problem. Not value for money. Had stayed here earlier, was given a better room. Not idle for old people and people on wheel chairs."
"I like the atmosphere, location and the staff's of the sea breaz. Front desk staff's too are really good."
Very good breakfast buffet. Helpful smiling staff. Good location. Easy to get passing taxis and tuk tuks. Interesting little museum with Prince Phillip's car. Attractive general areas.
Awful bare unattractive small room. Only one bedside light. Basic overhead shower. No bath. Tiny bottles of cheap shampoo etc. Room not cleaned by 4 pm so just obtained replacement towels from passing cleaner. Towels thin and frayed. Bar food was served cold and soggy
amazing views/location and front of house facilities - Restaurant/breakfast on site - Simply stunning !
"Pleasant dinning, great staff, good location. Good live band one night."
"Paid for a deluxe queen room. Room was small,view of a dirty ally-way,and showed its age.,"
"The location of the landmark hotel is brilliant. as well as the history. The management is there poor. Rather uncomfortable for the lady travellers. No personal touch, no guest relation appointed managers we met. no welcome we have experienced. as much as we regret."
Location is brilliant as well as an atmosphere of the landmark hotel and the ambience. When service is missing
Good terrace overlooking the water for food and cocktails
Wasn’t allocated the room I requested. The room smelled of damp and little concern showed by staff to resolve. Eventually I was moved but not without a fight which was a real shame.
Nice grounds and beautiful old building. In general staff extremely nice. Buffet breakfast and lunch were very good.
Great spot great pool and nice bar and restaurant
Not really value for the money you pay compared to other places. Concierge service not overly helpful
"Excellent staff, good breakfast"
"Overpriced small rooms, uncomfortable beds"
"The staff at the reception is very rude and non-professional. But I only had bad experience with one staff. Other staffs at the hotel is very helpful. The hotel is has easy access to supermarket, shopping center and beach. Jewelry store is worth to visit. The breakfast at the hotel is good."
Beautiful old hotel with a rich and interesting history which has bee very well refurbished. We loved looking out at the sea and it has a good pool area.
"Location, clean, good food, no pests, great laundry service"
The bathroom flooded every time the shower was used & everytime we got it dried it was never fully dry
"Location and people Good , Breakfast Excellent and Chef was so co operative to support for Pure Veg Food and Guided us."
