Cinnamon grad hotel is my 2nd home .Friendly helpful Humbled staff members very professional .All different food restaurants to cater for any culture religions and to meet up medical requirements   are excellent I like everything of the Hotel and  hope and Pray for the hotel to be normal after the reason shocking news
Everything
Great location.  Beautiful large pool area with lovely poolside dining. Many choices for eating. We had a huge corner room. Staff were very helpful. Great breakfasts.  
"The Breakfast included amazing options, Sri-Lankan, South Indian, Continental. Wide spread of Breads, pastries and cheese platter's with choices of Tea and coffee suiting one's taste. The poolside bar and restaurant's at the hotel were good stay in hotel option's if one want's to relax. SPA facilities and salon were also good value for money with in the premises. We had a late night flight and we were provided with late check-out facility which was great for us."
Nothing I recollect.
"Great welcome from Fabian on check in. This is a luxurious hotel, with everything you need. The breakfast buffet is vast with lovely freshly made juices! Try out the tasty hoppers. The rooms were well appointed. We particularly enjoyed the restaurants in particular Tao restaurant. Fantastic Chinese food! You can people watch in the huge lobby or listen to the piano music with a cocktail"
Nothing
"Location, spacious room, great facilities including huge pool"
"Could not control AC, so room was cold, and master switch shuts down power points, which means charging of phones and PCs does not happen"
Comfy and clean room. Great location for shopping and sightseeing. Staff are friendly. Late check-out at 4pm was much appreciated. Breakfast at Taprobane was amazing and well worth the money. 
Rooms in the Courtyard Wing were tired and not maintained to a high standard. Furniture was worn and fading. Mini bar was empty and no water was provided in the rooms. 
Facility
"Staff, especially the people who handled the banquet for our workshop. They were unavailble at most times and were hard to reach out to or get help from.In room dining and room cleaning were average. They made a lot of mistakes with cleaning, providing basic help like cups, plates etc and sometime our order placed was not catered to and we kept waiting all night for the same."
Good location in Colombo. Very good food. Excellent staff.
"Our second stay at the hotel during this visit. Although booked a premium room as previously, this time room was small, not suitable for a family and not value for money."
"Good comfortable room. Very good food with plenty of choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Taprobane restaurant. Excellent service from staff."
"I had higher expectations for a 5* hotel. The hotel probably requires renovation, as the price doesn't match the offer. I pay attention to things like slippers, shampoo and soap, and such small details, and they were unsatisfactory. The shower door did not close/latch properly, and water would flood the entire bathroom. The hotel is lacking in aesthetics when it comes to bathroom amenities. The gym is fully equipped and overlooks a nice green area, but the equipment was noticeably old. Out of the many restaurants, I tried Lagoon (Seafood), and it had a market feel. Whether that was deliberate or not, I can't tell for sure, but it didn't have a 5* hotel feel to it. Not faulting the cleanliness, but the waiting staff were so busy, it took 40 minutes for someone to explain how ordering food works around there. I would say, overall, it is a nice hotel, and the staff were very kind and helpful most of the time, but I'd rate it 4* instead of 5."
"This is an excellent hotel just off the Galle Face Road.      A brilliant swimming pool, nice restaurants and comfortable rooms await.     All of the services and facilities are excellent."
The hotel is relatively expensive.
Great breakfast. Central location. Helpful staff.
A premium room for 3 adults was booked. This was not available on our arrival. Room offered was too small and lower spec. Eventually moved to premium room but third person had to sleep on a camp bed!
"Always a dependable and comfortable stay in Colombo. Central to everything and with great restaurants, if you choose to eat in the hotel. Rooms are good value for money (restaurants are  slightly expensive) and its a hotel that delivers exactly what one would expect of a large property like it."
"14 restaurants to chose from - no need to leave the complex! Lots of staff to look after you, nothing too much trouble: I went to plug my phone in and someone was there to offer to do it for me. I swatted a fly whilst sat in the reception area and registered someone had noticed me -  5 minutes later a ""fly swatter"" had been deployed! OTT but that's what you get for 5 stars."
"Staffs are very kind. All facilities are convient. Everything is perfect but one thing, food."
"You didn't set Korean foods. Please prepare some Korean foods.  If so, many Korans must come more and more."
"Breakfast was a great deal. Superb variety. The hotel is centrally located and extremely popular as a meeting spot for people who aren't guests. The lobby scene is vibrant and active through the late night hours. There are 14 restaurants to choose from, all superb. The quality of the service is outstanding. The hotel staff are friendly and accommodating and always greet you with a smile on meeting you. I couldn't be more pleased with the service here and I will return."

"Very friendly and professional staff. 
Room services staff Ihasan was very friendly in perticularly. 
"
There was a thin dust in the room and I got a breathing difficulty during my two days stay at the hotel. 
Bed was comfy. Staff was friendly
Our room had a bad view overlooking the parking and there was a noise coming from the train.  Reception gave our friends who came later a better view but had told us they had nothing better at the time.  Breakfast buffet was average!
"The restaurants are superb. Nuga Gama, the village in a forest clearing under a banyan tree, is worth a visit to Colombo on its own. It is a really lovely experience, an enormous range of curries, beautiful lighting, pleasant staff and a live combo playing nice local music.Tao, the Chinese restaurant, is also in a beautiful setting, with fish swimming in ponds around the restaurant. The service is superb; I unfortunately didn't get the names of the delightful and professional managers, but my waiter there twice (Nasitha) could not have been more helpful.The London Grill is an upmarket fine dining restaurant. I didn't feel the service or atmosphere were as good as the restaurants previously mentioned (the candles were not lit; when I asked about them I was told the wrong fuel had been delivered...), but the food was excellent.The room was comfortable and clean, and looked down onto the pool, where there was a very nice bar (Breeze Bar), which was handy day and night for snacks and cocktails."
"The concierge was horrible and in fact rruined my holiday and made it unlikely I'll return to Sri Lanka.  On checking in I mentioned to the extremely pleasant front desk woman (Leeza) that I needed to get train tickets and she said not to worry about it, the concierge would sort that out. I went to him half an hour later with my 1st 2nd and 3rd choice of tickets for either of two trains on a sheet of paper. He waved it away and said ""Oh no, I'd be on the phone for ages"" (he was busy with nothing else) as there would be confusion over what class seating I would require. I pointed out that everything was very clear on the piece of paper, but he said No, just go to the station ypourself, it's not far. When I got to the station I was told there were no tickets for the day I wanted, though \I could get a ticket back when I needed one. I later returned and bought the return ticket and after a lot of haggling paid a taxi driver over 80 US Doillars to drive me to my destination.(Ella). When I arrived in Ella after a very long drive, a young couple arrived at the same time as me and when I told them about my attempted ticket purchase they said the ticket staff at the station were so rude and unhelpful that they had gone back to their hotel and asked the concierge to help and he had got them tickets. What was really annoying was that not only did I have to pay $80 instead of about $5 for a train ticket, but - even worse - that the concierge was so rude and totally unhelpful.. On my return to Colombo (NOT staying at the Cinnamon Grand) I complained about the incident to a manager called Davina, who lamely said she'd look into it. I pointed out to her that the concierge (a middle-aged man) was hardly likely to admit he had behaved in this way"
"The property is huge and adjacent to a Shopping Mall, very conveniently located. Reception staff extended our stay till 4 PM on the last day, without even any request from us."
Nothing as such
Such a great variety of restaurants right on site and great staff!!
The room already costs a lot so its too bad that they charge you an extra $25USD / day for an extra cot in your room.  
"The coffee was good, Chutneys the restaurant was amazing as usual. also enjoyed a meal at noodles a Vietnamese restaurant ( zaira assisted in the selection of lovely dishes ) in the hotel. Recommend Gallery cafe approx 2 kms away for continental food.front office Amanda n Steve were very helpful."
"The Toilet does not have a Jet Spray, very important for us Indians, but they provided us with an alternative pot."
"Thought the Reception staff were fantastic - Prabash couldn't have been more helpful.  As this was the second time we had stayed at the Cinnamon Grand in a month, he remembered us and made sure that everything was perfect.  Loved the Pool Bar as I mentioned before....one of my favorite places 'East of Suez'.  The night we arrived went to use the hairdryer and it didn't work - housekeeping were there withing 5 minutes and the dryer was replaced - the next morning went to iron something and the iron didn't work - yet again Housekeeping were there within 5 minutes.....brilliant."
"Well, the breakfast service could be a little more 'switched on'.  The main staff seem to work extremely hard but the 'suits' seem to be lacking in overall control.  Repeatedly, items would be depleted and one would have to ask....would be lovely to have some fresh orange juice instead of cordial....competitors in Colombo all seem to offer same....."
"Super comfortable room. Huge variety of restaurants and food and very reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel. A British pub (Cheers) that actually looked like a British pub. Great location, within walking distance of all the main attractions in Colombo. Staff friendly and helpful almost to a fault. Decent gym and a nice swimming pool."
Nothing
Staff
There was confusion as to pricing and correspondance from jet wing. This accidentally caused  a very large problem. The staff needed all correspondances from  the main office.
"Everything was excellent.The greeting ,the armosphere ,and also not to forget the food.Taste wonderful.A big thank you to Mr Chandimal.He is one of the best at the concierge for his greetings and services.Keep it up. BEST HOTEL TO STAY FOR HOLIDAY."
Nothing.
"Everything about the hotel.The rooms were large,clean and well maintained.The  hotel is grand"
"In the restaurant Chutneys ,they do not  provide finger bowls .All guest are supposed to go to the common basin to wash their hand.The basin is not well maintained"
"Service very very poor. Many guests complaining every day about lack of staff one pool waiter for entire area 50 mins to get water or coke brought Lazy dinning staff leaving dirty tables not clearing them off. Walk past and leave An Asian man standing pool side clearing his throat and nose and spitting in pool. 2 days in a row.   Complaint to hotel manager not even a response back. Disgusting. Many people around pool told the Asian man off he did not care. Repeated again next day  clearly management did nothing !!"
"Rooms are great and if you enjoy Sri Lankan culture you get to watch some incredible weddings.    It is a great hotel, fantastic food and great outdoor area around the pool.    Fantastic big trees that block most of the city and make you feel that you in an oasis somewhere... pool and the bar are a fantastic escape.   Compare it to bland rooftop exposed and windy pool areas elsewhere... families can stay down in the pool area all day if they wish and totally manned all the time.   Crescat shops attached are also pretty handy and the food court and supermarket in the basement are welcomed escape."
"Excellent service, excellent facilities and amenities, clean and spacious rooms"
"Apart from buffet, restaurants were expensive. If you wanted breakfast the only option was to pay £10 for the buffet.
Food service at the pool was slow, on average 30-40 minutes for a chicken Caesar! Birds around pool area are really annoying and also a health hazard "
"Big complex with a lot of conveniences including restaurants, bars, pools etc. Very good breakfast. "
Check in took quite a while which was annoying. Transfers to airport organised by the hotel are very expensive compared to outside rates
"What a superb hotel! The staff make this place what it is. They are friendly, courteous and nothing is too much for them. They went out of their way to ensure we had a fantastic stay. The facilities and restaurants around the hotel are stunning and this really is the best place you could want to stay at in Colombo."
Nothing.
"Pool Bar at night - balmy breeze going through,"
Nothing really apart from the daily egg frying battle - staff didn't listen but did their own thing.
I visited Cinnamon earlier few times but this time stayed 2 nights with family ( 6th to 8th Jan 2019 ). I like their Hospitable Service. Thank you.
"The pool bar area is filled with mosquitoes was quite shocked, even complained to the waiter."
"Very comfortable bed in a well appointed room. Staff were always extremely friendly and welcoming. Super pool space with plenty of sun loungers. Nice Breakfast buffet. Amazing Sri Lankan village style place ""Nuga Gama"" An oasis of calm in Colombo."
"Tuk tuk's need to be ordered to Crescat Boulevard as they're not allowed into hotel drop off point...
Touts outside hotel, during late hours, asking if you want Thai ladies...
Breakfast service slightly chaotic due to lack of staff numbers...
"
"A super posh place to stay in Colombo that lives up to all expectations. The room service menu is superb and (by American standards) very cheap. We stayed here as a place to sleep off some jet lag, and I could not have been more satisfied. Highly attentive staff who will help you with pretty much anything. There's a little mall next to the hotel with a fantastic food court."
Location is good and easy to go anywhere in the town. Good internet in the hotel. Nice swimming pool and bar. Good drinks. The staff is attentive.
"Not a really bad thing, but they use the inside hall (access to your apartment) for celebrations like weddings. It can be quite noisy. Fortunately the bedrooms have really good sound isolation from this area."
"Very poorly staffed. Constantly waiting for upto an hour for a drink. No organisation. Had to complain about an Asian clearing his throat and spitting in pool ! Staff not very concerned about this vile action"
Poor staff level and tile spent waiting for service
"location, ambience, eagerness of the staff to assist, variety of restaurants, especially the counter staff at check in, the doorman, and the concierge , value for money at the coffee shop"
"some staff are not fluent in English, would have liked more information about places to see in around Colombo. Inadequate information about the nature parks near  Colombo. A colour street  map of Colombo and suburbs would be useful ."
excellent location with excellent customer service
"The Taprobane restaurants can be seriously understaffed during busy periods. Management need to take a close look at it, they need at least 5/10 more people setting up tables and serving the guests"
i didn't expect better things in there_ in terms of accommodation and in terms of foods.
"i wanted to view the sea/ocean from the window, but that could not be helped for obvious reasons."
"The hidden costs adding on by the hotel. We had booked our room at $840 AUD Only for them to charge my credit card $1,030 AUD due to hidden costs that weren’t mentioned online. Very disappointed"
I have been staying in Cinnamon Grand for last several years and has been the my preferred and safe selection
Rigid and inflexible time on check out request.
"the staff were all polite and very helpful. my room were well cleaned and amenities were sufficient. enjoyed the breakfast very much which had offerings of European and local dishes."
"What do we like ? Chandimal the concierge. He went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. Kudos Chandimal!.Christina from the business center was incredibly forthcoming and helpfull when we wanted some help with preparing our son's application for Elizabeth Moir. Thank you Christina!Niroshini and the other girls from in-room dining was top notch. She helped us with recommendations and we ended up trying most of the in-room dining menu!Shobi and the Jazz quartlet at the lobby were outstanding.Not withstanding a particularly annoying one named ""Nuwan"" from Housekeeping staff who hounded ( ""Did you write a review for me? "", "" Sir I am going to check internet(sic) NOW, when will you write a REVIEW for me ?"" ) us for Trip Advisor reviews and a few hopelessly incompletent but alarmingly snooty women at the reception, the staff was generally outstanding. We tried 6 of the14 restaurants and the food was good and service very good there.Staff makes or breaks a stay. A stay could be laced with Michelin Star restaurants but unmotivated, snooty staff can be a stinker.We have mixed memories from the Cinnamon Grand. Sahan SeneviratneIT ConsultantOttawa, Canada"
"Nuwan from Housekeeping. Stay away from him and his supervisors.Unexplainably aloof, perpetually busy saree clad indviduals at reception. Yikes!"
"The chicken curry served at breakfast on the club floor was one of the best I experienced in Sri Lanka, the staff were superb we felt very welcome & cared for after very long flight, offered upgrade to club floor, shown to room & room features explained, room clean & adequate."
The hotel decor looks a little tired
"My room was great - comfy bed, good pillows and a great bathroom and shower. My colleagues room was not quite at the same standard and so it's worth checking on your room facilities when you book."
The breakfast buffet was 'ok' - not as good as others that I've experienced in other hotels in Colombo. Not as much choice and some elements had a look that made them seem less appetizing than they were.
"The breakfast area not convenient , it’s should be in GF or at lest have lift facilities. The lift also too old and slow speed .The dental kit , tooth brush was too hard not usable .Other thing is ok .The lobby was fantastic."
Restaurant choices
The air conditioning in my room did not get very cold and just circulated the air. The room was also dated compared to a colleagues. This was room 675.
"Helpful & friendly staff, clean, many restaurants for food choices and just felt like it was home away from home. Oh also awesome salon and close to a supermarket and other buys for tourists."
"The restaurant food was fantastic- especially the Srilankan restaurant. Breakfast great, rooms good, lobby was lovely. Bar service a bit slow. Rooms were spacious and good"
DEcor outside the rooms a bit mundane
"Oh my goodness everything and almost everyone! The conveniences, all the great restaurants, the amazingly friendly staff from the front door to house keeping was phenomenal. Lovely, lovely stay very accommodating and helpful in every way. Thank you so much!"
"Breakfast was excellent, restaurant options within hotel great variety, pool area /bar, lobby live music in evenings, the pool bar live music sunday evening....."
No Complaints from me...
"Everything is like about Cinnamon Grand....food .staff. Location. Pool. Rooms.Firstly the greeting you get on arrival sure makes you feel they care.....Leeza checked us in and was so welcoming.Would certainly highly recommend this hotel to all my friends and family."
Nothing.....
"It was just great to be in Cinnamon grand, one of the finest place in Sri Lanka. The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful with excellent professional touch. My special compliments to Miss Irushi for all the assistance and help.  It was a lovely stay."
Everything was perfect
"The room, the service, the friendlynes"
"The food - unprofessional prepared. in the Noodles Restaurant show kitchen chefs touch cooked / prepared food with bare fingers.Cooking and presentation is below any international standard. Taste very bad - the dishes are not authentic."
Leaving Cinamon Grand was my favourite part.
"It is a very old hotel, it seems royal but it is not. Smell of fish and dirty water surrounds the outside of the hotel, pool is not enjoyable. Our bed smelt like someone had peed in it and the room itself smelt old and dirty. The overall functionality of the room is poor too, no power connections; we only had 1 in the whole room. The toilet is cramped and dirty. Its not worth the money. Too expensive for a very poor quality that it offers."
"I liked the location and friendly staff.Breakfast was sumptuous and open till 1030.lively atmosphere in the lobby and happy hours between 7 and 8 pm on malt drinks."
"Need more trained staff during peak breakfast service, Place gets crowded and I felt the restaurant was understaffed. This is the first time I stayed with Cinnamon Grand, I normally stay at the Hilton. However, the service levels are comparable."
Average
"As Booking.com is one of your options for reservation of room for your clients like us. We haven't even know Grand Cinnamon hotel and got to know through booking.com. We would like to say for cancellation or add my reservation, property have the right to modify the bookings. Emergency situation visitors may needs to short or extend their stay. Your hotel couldn't provide any support after informing at the very begaining of the stay and finnaly my colleages needs to pay for four nights without staying rest two days as they needs to check out after two days. Neither this types of situation may increase the dissatisfaction among the guests. Hope you understand."
"The breakfast is good as well as the  bed which is very comfortable . The only black point is the Bath room , always leakage of water and this can drain down the positive side of the hotel"
"the Bathroom as said above , the only pain point . 2nd time I am experiencing same"
"Perfect location in Colombo, with easy access to transport, restaurants, and shops. Super comfy rooms, great wi-fi, and an abundance of in-house restaurants and bars."
Average check in experience. Room service takes a while.
"We have stayed at the hotel at least once a year for more than a decade. At this point, especially considering the abundance of newer hotels from which to choose, CG feels tired and the service spotty at best. Housekeeping was particularly spotty with one excellent maid and others who were definitely not on point. We stayed 3 weeks so we had plenty of time to judge. If not for proximity to family, we would have stayed elsewhere."
"Staff were rude and snobbish, during check in the card I had used to reserve the room was declined so we used a different one to make payment. After being shown our room an attendant was sent in to remove everything inside the mini bar. We stood and watched on as he placed everything in to a plastic bag, whilst explaining that the reception staff had told him to do so. It was extremely uncomfortable for both parties and we had literally been in the room for only a couple of minutes. The room was tired and shabby, with flaking paint and plug sockets which didn't work. We were glad to leave in the morning and would not recommend, definitely not what we would have expected from a 5 star hotel. Disgusting and rude behaviour from the staff who did not make us feel welcome."
The hotel  is well situated  and provides different types af transport within  easy reach. The breafast has wide range of foodstuffs Moreover the front line staff  is very friendly and efficient. A small shopping mall is attached to the hotel with a food court whereby gusts may stroll .
"The staff was friendly and very helpful at all times. The hotel can accomodate  several events at a time like wedding  reception  , conference etc....  This contributes to the hotel""s lively atmosphere. The cafe is s  good place to entertain friends with live music as background.  However the rooms appear old  and furniture requires an uplift. Overall  a very good hotel with minor issues for improvement. I would  strongly recommend this hotel for stay."
Staff were friendly and helpful. Clean property. Easy location. Liked dining areas specially for vegetarian guests. Nice lobby with good music and very attentive staff. Certainly will recommend to friends and family
For a triple room they provided a folding bed for the third person. Poor lighting in corridors. Noisy during functions. Airport transfer was pricy from the travel desk. We opted for private transfers which was considerably less expensive.
I like the staff who served the breakfast. They are so friendly and the food is nice.
"The sound approved was so poor. The last night stayed in Cinnamon Grand hotel, I totally cannot sleep because it was so noisy from the next door. Can hear everything, flash toilet, talking, door closing, walking sound... Staff knocked my door few times at 9.30pm asking for housekeeping. Not sure, is that a normal practice in Sri Lanka hotel? The room is much under my expectation with the money I paid. Not worth it at all!"
Quality hotel with good facilities. Central and resort like features with a large number of restaurants all reasonably priced.
Check out could be quicker. Plenty of computer terminals but not enough staff attending to those leaving in the morning peak.
"Efficient, comfortable, large hotel. Spotless room, great shower. Attractive pools. Excellent buffet breakfast choice. Staff friendly and attentive. Large range of restaurant choices."
I would prefer to have my own teapot at breakfast. The waiting staff were so busy it took forever to get a top up.
"Breakfast not up to par with a continental breakfast.  Food is of poor quality.  Also had dinner at Chutneys and the food is very average.  If you wish to cater to tourists, please upgrade the quality of your food."
"checking out from there.. moved to kingsburry, just worth it.. cinnamon grand is good for its restaurants and not for the stay.."
they do not know how to treat the guest's and the guest's request's.. very very poor PR.. so many more things to say instead would just like to say please do not stay there and also the bathrooms have no health faucets...very poor toileterie's...
Been there before many times and generally good experiences so keep going. The Indian restaurant Chutneys is my favourite. The Italian restaurant Echo was very good too.
Noise in the Lobby and the ceremonies and functions at base level of atrium made them very noisy due to high echo. Could be disturbing at lower floors. Maybe try a different one next time for some more quite
The place is centrally located.The breakfast is a feast.The guys in the kitchen and dining are awesome
The check in process was too slow.Too many hidden charges with BnB
Everything was good and excellent about this hotel. No second thoughts of me traveling to the place again with or without family. But only one thing I had issue with Booking.com since it was a non refundable booking when I preponed my date of return the hotel said it might be difficult but they did give the benefit of reality and accepted the preponement without any financial damage.
Nothing about the hotel
I liked nothing
"It was the worst experience of my life, in the middle of the night a Chinese couple enters to my room,while I was fast asleep and ask me to move out from my room. Couple had the room key where same room no. was mentioned. So, basically there staff is so negligent or there booking system's still survives on hand written register. Where they could not figure out that they have given me this room in afternoon and they are allotting the same room to couple. Very unprofessional staff did not even came to apologize about the incident, until and unless I did not went down for check out. My suggestion would be not to stay in this hotel, even if it is for free, you never know who will barge inn in your room in the middle of the night. PATHETIC."
"Excellent staff, great facilities with a wide choice of restaurants all serving excellent food at reasonable prices"
"The standard room is a little small, I’d recommend Deluxe and above"
"Comfortable room,breakfast very good and good restaurants on site.The location is very good.  The staff were very helpful and attentive and very efficient"
The reception on the TV was not good
"Location was superb and service too from the moment of check-in to checkout at 5 am in the morning was unparalleled. Few hotels could probably match it. Efficiency and kindness of each staff member one encountered - and such a huge hotel (14 restaurants) necessitates an enormous body of staff - was exemplary and spontaneous. The Chinese restaurant Tao was so good we spent both evenings. Lovely ambience, service and cuisine."
Nothing.
Staff are friendly and courteous which then delivers a great atmosphere and with the hotel close to all shopping centres and attractions it’s the right and best place to stay.
"Every time we visit Sri Lanka we stay here. A huge variety of eating places. Excellent staff, especially Sanjay at the front desk."
Coffee shop a bit chaotic
"The bed is good, the staff are very friendly, helpful & hospitality.Room has everything people need, Family Hotel. has joined market.They have guest house for stay those who's catch night flight."
"The extra bed was like stone, TV wasn't clear, only one restaurant open 24 hour, less Taxi next to the hotel, as the hotel car is very expensive"
"Chamlia and the executive lounge team we're fantastic. As we're my floor butlers, basically all staff were exemplary, professionals. The best service I've ever received of any hotel I've had the pleasure of staying at."
Everything was perfect
"1. Amazing customer service and wonderful staff.
2. Clean place, positive energy everywhere, happy people and peaceful environment.
3. The food is unbelievable and heavenly delicious and can't describe the wonderful taste.
4. They are amazing."
Comfy room and very tastefully decorated.
Unfriendly staff and the lack of a warm inviting welcome... the check in process was the worst i have encountered...
Excellent management they listened to our complaint very profesionaly and even waved some F&B charges
The food and beverage service at the restaurant was very slow as was room service and the staff kept telling is food is read but still took half an hour to arrive
Centrally situated in Colombo with easy access to most facilities including an adjoining shopping mall.
My first visit to the Cinnamon Grand and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience there
Accommodated our request after the initial mishap 
"Initial room’s toilet was flooding 
We were then given another room which could not accommodate 3 beds
When we complained we were given s very good room how ever the additional bed was not comfortable "
"We have been at the Cinnamon many times as we feel like at home. The staff members are very kind and respectful, the room was clean and the hotel has many great restaurants and is at the heart of Colombo."
"As we stayed on the 9th floor, there was some noise probably coming from works been done on the flat roof."
"Very nice hotel, spacious, very clean. staff helpful and friendly. Great location close to every thing. Non smoking and quiet."
Bed to soft for us and non fitted sheet.
"We stayed here for one night as it was only a short 45 minute drive from the airport into Colombo and we needed somewhere post flight to recharge batteries ahead of a 2 week holiday.It's a beautiful hotel - with some amazing restaurants and a great pool. Thoroughly enjoyable stay."
"We were only there for 1 night - so nothing to grumble about really. It hammered it down with rain for an hour in the evening - but hardly the hotel's fault! The staff did constantly push tripadvisor cards our way with their names on - but again without positive reviews they don't get noticed, so it's understandable."
everything was in the room perfectly arranged. Mr. Wiganeshwar who served us the room service beyond the expectations.. he was kind enough to take care of every need. humble knowledgeable staff member ever.
N/A
"Good food and average room..Old rooms..Room service is good. Serves in 30min exactly.House keeping is good.. any requests made, helped us on time..Good staff from Travel.. but expensive .."
"Hotel staff... Not sure, what their job is .. I wish your camera reviews /monitors their job atleast now and pays attention to customersHotel lobby ...It’s completely a business hotel and not for people who visit for a vacation or leisure purpose.Reception area or lobby is always occupied with crowd(don’t know who they are).. you can’t sit and relax in the lobby.. They might want you to be in the room or visit the mall all time..(not to relax anywhere else)Hotel restaurent staffs..You get complementary breakfast.. But no attention from staffs.. there is some exception, who still believe in their hardwork( few women staff were amazingly hardworking during such peak morning time )You have choice of food from 14 different places within Cinnamon grand.Food is good..But....Every restaurant staff.. wants you to give feedback about them.. So they give you a long name list and request you to put it on TripAdvisor before 12AM :) .. Whoever reads this, correct me, if I’m wrong..Checkin:Checkin was Smooth.. But people in the reception can have some some smile on their face.. Can Your camera monitor this?? This might help you to increase some ratings.. without any additonal efforts.."
"The room is quite old. The carpet smells. The service in the coffee shop was bad. Very slow. I need to follow up my order twice & i need to go to the counter to get my bill. Poor service. The lagoon restaurant is highly recommended. Staff & service was fantastic."
"Am a frequent stayer at this property. And they dined to to have a early check in of 2 hour in advance. No privilege, No courtesy, ...... They should at least consider who had stayed with more times. I requested them am checking out early too. They won't care at all saying it's hotel policy. But as a frequent guest,,,,,,"
"i like the facilities, i've requested a good and nice view of room and did gave it . i tried the dinner buffet and i love it . the breakfast makes my day start energetic . the staff are very nice .good bar to cheers. so relaxing and comfortable and securable . i'll be back soon ."
nothing but i was expected that i can have a bay view room .. but its fine .
The beds were comfy and the room overall clean
When in the pool area the extractor chimney coming from the kitchen ( I assume) emitted black toxic smoke for approximately 3 minutes and left a foul smell and smoke over the pool
Staff / location of hotel
"No door bell, could not hear people knocking when I was in the bedroom. Why doesn’t a 5* hotel have a bell. Missed room service and guests thought I was ignoring them. I don’t think other people should be allowed to sign on my bill when I’m not in the room. It was a lady’s room but they were letting men sign for meals, cigarettes and drinks when I was not there or sleeping. It should be only the owner (person paying) who is allowed to sign for products on my bill? I can’t help it if my acquaintances  and their friends are cheap. In Dubai a man would never disrespect himself by letting a woman pay for him. I am not used to that and was surprised by the large room service bill I was handed at the end."
Good location.
"Cinnamon Grand was a disappointment. Some of the phones in our suite were not working, some of the light bulbs had blown and the tube light in the walk-in wardrobe was flickering. Moreover, we had to wait on the line for ages for reception and housekeeping to answer the phone. Obviously our suite had been unused for a long time. It would have been better for a staff member to occupy the suite to identify all the issues before letting it out to guests.There was also no privacy in the hotel. My wife and I felt that we were being watched every moment. When I went out for dinner and walked into the hotel, a staff member asks me, “Can I help you?” In a rather curt manner. Very unpleasant indeed."
"I have booked this property for my colleque , this is a gift for him.But ,property have charged from him , even though I sent a mail request not to charge from him, charge from my  card.  DISAPPOINTED"
"The staff are what makes this place truly Grand. Every person I spoke with was very attentive, energetic and helpful. The number of restaurants is dazzling, and the rooms/facilities are impeccable. Pricey, but worth the money!"
"The location is excellent, and the food has always been consistently good for many years. Favourite restaurant was Taos, disappointed that it is changed to a Chinese restaurant."
Changing Tao to a Chinese restaurant.
"Since my mother and i had a really early flight unfortunately we did not have a chance to enjoy the breakfast at the hotel. Instead our receptionist Teshan was so kind to prepare a lovely to-go breakfast box that was ready when we checked out, we enjoyed it on the way to the airport. It is right next to a mall which we also enjoyed and a great coffee bar with lots of tasty cakes that we brought up to our room after dinner. Wish we had longer time to stay at this lovely hotel."
"Room was extremely comfortable, staff were very courteous and friendly and all facilities available if required. Probably what made my stay even better was the staff themselves. I did not want for anything, and even though I was travelling alone, and this was my first visit tho the Grand, I felt as if I had been before."
Food in the accosicated restaurants were very tasty and of high quality.
"The personnel seemed a bit disorganised, both in the hotel and in the associated restaurants we tried.
We expected a higher comfort for this price."
"Useful small shopping mall beside the hotelGreat staffsGood house keeping serviceGood cafe shope"
"Very old furnitures General design of corridors was so old.A lot of business men around."
"Tennis court was a pleasant surprise but it needs to be better maintained. I liked the service and friendly staff too and Coffee Stop was the best for its coffee, pastries and macaroons!"
Tennis court wasn’t well maintained. The fences had holes in them and balls kept flying out through the holes.
The lobby area is buzzing with energy all the time. Loved the music that was being played most of the time and your seafood restaurant gets full marks. the most amazing sea food that I have ever had. Also breakfast was excellent.
The rooms are really dated. They don't have the modern look that most 5 stars have nowadays. Need to improve the rooms.
"Very good choice of restaurantsFriendly staffLocation"
"Organised taxi service extremely expensive versus private or localEg airport $52 via hotel, $30 elsewhere."
"Food at Lagoon was good, I appreciate and enjoyed the complementary coconut snack."
"I could hear sounds/voices of other customers in corridor from inside my room and sometimes they were rather loud. The Chinese food at Tao restaurant was just average. We ordered steam fish but the meat consistency was a bit lacking."
I had previously broken my foot and all staff were extremely helpful
Extra tax payments were not notified on booking.com website and we paid 30% which is more than most hotels. Hotel and booking.com bed to be clearer’s as our receipt notification said total price and this was incorrect
It was well lit and comfortable.
The room which was given to me earlier. I refused to take it. A female traveling with her little daughter should not be given adjoining rooms.
"I like the new room they give it to me ,,, I like the restaurant in this hotel"
"The first old room they give it to meThe kangaroo taxi was problem not come on time when they call them"
"It says on the booking site that shuttle bus to the airport is available which is wrong.  There is no shuttle bus, you can get a hotel taxi for USD46, while the meter taxi will cost half the price."
Great value for a 5* suite for us and our toddler. Fantastic facilities and choice of restaurants.
"Original suite was by an elevator shaft so very noisy ALL night, but they moved us the following day and upgraded us"
"Easy access to everything. The shopping mall next to the hotel, makes your life easy."
The rooms aren’t soundproof. Some Tamil musical show was held next to the hotel the day we went. It was loud and we couldn’t sleep till midnight. 
Clean with lots of restaurants and facilities. 
"Given check in time was 1, I tried to check in at 4 and the room was still not ready for 40 mins. On the upside they upgraded me to a suite.
Some parts of the hotel are looking dated, like the front desk, if you look up,  there are cracks all over near the vents, the paint is a different shade between the old and new wing, hardly issues, but hardly 5 star standard. "
The room was extremely comfortable as was the bed. It was in fact very difficult to get out of bed in the morning although it was helped by the delivery of a great breakfast. In room dining is so much nicer and food was delivered on time every time.
I have stayed in this hotel twice in the last few weeks and each time on check in the front desk staff tried to debit more from my credit card than they said they would. Coincidence?  Matbe but always worth checking the sum to be debited.
"The facilities, restaurants and pool in this first class hotel were excellent."
The rooms were very small and I would have expected better for the price we paid.
"Food here is amazing especially the breakfast Beds are very comfy"
Check in could be a lot quicker. It seemed very slow. Also the keys didn’t work to get into one of the rooms. Which was a bit annoying after a long flight .
everything except what I'm going to write below
"after we put the do not disturb sign, the reception starts to call to ask when are we going to clean the room, after that housekeeping calls for same . so much disturbance! even after we showed tat we didn't like these calls, the hotel kept on doing this everyday, many times, it made me really pissed off. the only reason why we stay in was to get some sleep and we see no point if hotel people call us many times. very disappointed.last time also it was same. no improvement."
"Excellent staff Very helpful Nice restaurants"
"The swimming pool has a sheesha area so you are passive smoking while swimming .Irritated to see that most who are using sheesha are non swimmers just ogling at girls in the pool!!"
"LAGOON RESTAURANT IS GREAT AND MAKE OUR NIGHT PERFECTSTAFF IN LAGOON THE MANAGER AND OTHER TEAM ARE GREATCHEF COOK IN LAGOON IS A SPECIALIST SEAFOODI WILL COME BACK ONE DAY"
"I HAD A BIT PROBLEM WITH CHECK IN WE ARRIVED 5:30AM THEREFORE WE WAS GIVEN GUEST REST ROOM TO WAIT TILL 9AMI GET INTO THE ROOM AROUND 10 AM ++ THAT WAS NOT PLEASANT WELCOMELONG DAY FOR US AFTER A LONG FLIGHT PLEASE CREATE AN EASY CHECK IN"
"Great location , shopping mall and food court next to hotel. Lovely staff , especially the young trainee  receptionist who was so helpful and enthusiastic about his job. Special mention to Merril at Breeze bar who was wonderful. Have stayed here a few times now and am never disappointed. I think it’s the best hotel in Colombo!"
Can’t think of anything!
"Loved the facilities in terms of the pool, well equipped gym, access to shops and the general relaxed charming atmosphere in the lobby etc."
"As a regular visitor I keep going back to the Cinnamon Grand mainly because of it's facilities in terms of restaurants and it's location. But every time at check in time, which is generally at 1 am in the morning we go to the room to find the Triple Room booking is not quite as we expected.The room is not ready for occupation. This is after we had communicated with hotel prior to arrival, about the bed configuration. This would avoid the hassle of having to get an UNSUITABLE fold up bed brought in at that late hour when all we want to do at that time is to go to bed after having spent a whole day travelling.Plus there were only two towels, cups, etc etc for 3 adults. My advise to the hotel would be to inform prospective guests at the time of booking that the hotel does NOT have TRIPLE ACCOMMODATION. This is one area that seriously needs improvement."
"Breakfast was fantastic ,lunch and dinner had a choice  of  fifteen restaurants,Nuga gama sri lanka village style dinner under the trees. Chutneys south indian  food.Transfer from airport to hotel was good driver was waiting for us.criscat mall was just next door to hotel entrance open till late."
Very comfortable and clean rooms
"It's more like a Vegas casino lobby when you come out of the lifts, there are always people (non hotel customers) around due to the many restaurants. Always having to make your way around them to get in or out. Unfortunately as I was heading out for excursions each day and would come back dishevelled, the staff would attempt to restrict me from entering but hold doors open for visitors. I couldn't get a table for dinner with friends as the restaurants were always fully booked."
The grounds were really nice and had a grand atmosphere
"The absolute rip off of 40% in taxes and service charges is disgusting and dishonest, it once again shows how Sri Lanka completely takes advantage of tourists"
"Great hotel. excellent service, everything you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. There are about 14 restaurant in the hotel. various varieties to choose from. And they serve great dishes as well. Wish I had more time to try all the restaurant."
The hotel was kind of busy on the outside. Cars come in and goes out non-stop. I wish they had a special place for disabled passengers. It can be a bit dodgy trying to park the car closest to the entrance when you have crazy traffic at your door step.
The bed abs pillows were really comfy. The food was amazing and the atmosphere festive.
"Some of the rooms are a little out of date: however, the hotel is in the process of renovating"
"Very courteous. No fuss on any request. Extremely clean rooms and bathrooms. 
It's a happening hotel where you cannot get bored . Saw some srilankan weddings , interesting.
There are plenty of restaurants with amazing food.
"
Nothing that I can point out that I did not like about the property.
Very comfy bed.  Nice if you like very large hotels. Food in the Lagoon restaurant was good.
"There were bird droppings around the pool, one even landed on my husbands plate at lunch."
The bed and the pillows were comfy. The hotel lobby is the best one can find in colombo. Express check out was efficient.
"The check in process was a bit cumbersome and it took quite a while (more than 25 minutes) as we had to make several calls for the formalities to be completed,before we got wifi and our passports back."
"Nice clean and comfortable rooms, good service from friendly staff, good shower pressure and water temperature, lots of reasonably priced restaurants and room service (the burgers are great!)"
"The hotel is a bit dated. There was a power cut in our room which took 45 mins to come and resolve (instantly fixed when they arrived so have a feeling it’s a common problem) - it made us late for a wedding we had traveled to Sri Lanka for so that was disappointing, but they did bring us some nice fruits and sweets to apologise after we complained."
"One of the best hotels I’ve had the pleasure of living in. Staff was super and when I informed them that my wife and I were on our 12th anniversary they sent a cake a and a bottle of wine to the room. The gym was top notch and the restaurants were brilliant. The location can’t be beat and the hotel taxis were available 24/7. The best hotel in Colombo, bar none!"
I suppose if really pushing it the only slight criticism was that the hotel taxis were very pricey considering than trickshaws were about 10 percent of the same price on the same distance.
"The customer service was excellent from start to finish.The children were welcomed with sweets and juice which they loved and the reception staff engaged with the children making them feel welcomed and important guests also.The view from the room was excellent as was room service."
We ordered a car prior to arrival to collect us from the airport but the car didn’t arrive. It was resolved at the airport quickly but this was disappointing.
Staff service was excellent !
"Initial room smelt Smokey so we needed to Change our room but that was done easily and quickly. Staff were very obliging to our request"
Great service and excellent room service breakfast. Good value for money overall. 
Shower door did not close properly.  Take care when stepping in and out. 
"Location, eating options, the vibrant vibe, a shopping mall next door."
Can get too crowded in season. Reserve your table at restaurants as even in-house guests can be kept waiting. The restaurants are popular with locals.
"The room is quite comfortable and sufficient place for children to play""hide & See""."
"Buffet manager & waiters are quite lacking flexibility & adjustment, we went on Jan 1st at 8:20 PM, still half vacancy are there, but they rejected us and said that is already booking, so sad, there is no adjustment at all, quite a disappoint. I believed, someone may have booked but not attend it at that night, it is better they can reconfirm it before they rejected customers."
The Premium Room on the first part of our stay!
"Deluxe Room was not as good as the Premium Room therefore slightly disappointed. It is of an old style, in a different wing!"
Location was good. 
Old property. Interiors are uninspiring. You will be asked to pay on the spot cash for every room service even at 11pm if your room is booked under a basic package. Service staff also felt like not trained well enough. It was difficult for us to communicate with our room service steward. Front desk also too curt. 
The ambiance was amazing. Topped that with the best homemade cookies and ice coffee. The staff were all amazing and we were yet to find something they couldn't or wouldn't be able to help with.
More HD TV channel with movies and entertainment.
Location is spot on and the restaurants are great
"Rooms needs updating. I don’t know whether it was 9th floor rooms but we could hear lifts every minute and we were literally at the other end of the corridor 
"
Very comfortable bed with lots of restaurants to pick from for dinner. Lobby was amazing and very beautiful. Lots to do inside the hotel which was good. Staff very friendly and attentive. 
Pool was pretty average for a 5 star hotel. Location not that good if you want to explore Colombo. 
"Everything was perfect. My wife is wheelchair bound. Our 2 kids are both 10yrs old. During booking, I requested for an accessible room plus connecting to another room (for the kids). I got exactly what I requested. The staff went out of their way to make our stay a memorable one. Good job to the staff and management of the hotel."
"As it was a huge hotel and a famous one at that, the drop off area seems to be a wee bit too busy to our liking. To get the perfect spot to drop off (due to my disabled wife) can be challenging sometimes."
breakfast was brilliant..staff was excellent...everyone eager to make our stay comfortable
I was disappointed with the room assignment. They gave us a room on the older side and the property was fairly run down...the view was poor from the room...the gloomy look on the older side of the property wasn't nice...
They have put a lot of space to the entrance of the room rather than taking care of the washroom. The washroom did not have enough space and quite hard to use as well. Did not include a good view for the room. As a five star hotel we expected more from Cinnamon Grand.
"What an amazing property.Our check-in was super smooth, very warm and welcoming staff. Sanjay in particular was amazing, he made sure we got the best room with good views, and went out of his way to get us checked-in and comfortable. They have some amazing little touches which ensures you can have the relaxing vacation you are after. The pool side area was my favourite - with bean bags, hammocks, food, drinks and Sheesha and the most lovely staff at the sheesha counter. It is really green with trees all around, and works as your own little haven away from the chaos of the city. Imagine, taking a quick swim in the pool after a day of sight-seeing and then relaxing with a glass of wine and sheesha or just laying in the hammock and watching the stars. The rooms are well sized, very clean and comfortable with views of the pool or city. I had two meals at their restaurant, Chutney, and both were delicious. We also had a couple drinks at their pool side bar, with live music. I recommend staying at this property. I will definitely come back when in Colombo next.Also shared on TripAdvisor: https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d597086-r542177841-Cinnamon_Grand_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html#"
"It was perfect, so nothing to not like."
"Tania at the reception was very good and helpful.She understand the guest better. Some guys at the front desk was ?Room service was good and overall good place to stay."
I liked the choice of pillows and the bed was nice and comfy.  The Lagoon restaurant is still one of my favourite restaurants in the world but we think the fish wasn't very fresh as we both got upset tummies after.
"They were under renovations at the time yet the prices were the same as high season yet all the beautiful things in the lobby were covered up and workmen were all over the place. The rooms themselves are very average, bathroom also just OK. I wanted more as the lobby is usually spectacular but the rooms were just average. The pizza from the Ecco restaurant was small and tasteless with no tomato sauce? We ordered it with fresh chilli and mushrooms yet there was no chilli taste."
"Very central location, very friendly + helpful staff, awesome airport shuttle with new Audi Q3, driver Mr. Andrew was funny + charming guy."
"For this price I expect new + clean room, reception could only give me one of the old rooms, theyare not worth the money! Small, not clean.Next time I expect new room in the new building / wing located directly in the back of reception desk!"
the service of the staff is excellent ... the breakfast    very very good ......all very good at this hotel   and we were in lot of hotel in the world .... cinnamon grand hotel is the best
nothing       all good
Everything. So many amazing restaurants. I have coeliac disease and they catered really well to my requirements. Nice to have a cocktail by the pool.
Only negative was that staff by the pool were friendly but inattentive - we had to ask for the menu and even after that had to approach them to get service. There were plenty of staff around so that wasn’t the issue. 
It is a large hotel with many facilities. it has a decent sized Mall attached to it which makes it convenient for any last minute shopping. the location is good and allows you to reach most places in reasonable time. The staff were always smiling and nice.
The room was a little tired and could do with some upgrades. there was a lot of noise coming in from the renovation/painting/structural work going on in the main lobby. In general the room service is slow.
Sea food restaurant had amazing range and was reasonably priced. Breakfast menu had lots of varieties.
"Washrooms: They are bit dated , property doenst have single lever mechanism to mix hot and cold water , also jet spray is missing with WC. I think jet spary is  an absolute must for personal hygiene and really needed for Muslim travelers."
Customer service and staff responsiveness is exceptional!
"Hotel under renovation and compared to newer better hotels, price is too high. Also low occupancy so lot of staff just walking around and food seems stale and old probably due to low occupancy turn over rate"
"The Hotel staffs were very kind and very freindly, especially the Concirge, Mr. Samantha, Mr. Sajeewa, and the Casher, Mr. Eranga.  They were very kind and gave me a very usefull informations not to drop into the various troubles.  Particurary Mr. Samantha is a very kind person who helped me, even if after my check-out  from the Hotel, because I lost my personal thing by my quite fault.  Really thank you for his help, so I want to stay again and want to meet with him."
"1, bed-size;    I felt the bed's length size is a little short, as even if my tall is 175cm around. And the bed's width size is OK.2, room sandal;    There is no sandals in almost excellent hotels in Sri Lanka, these inferiority matter were written in my article, the Lanka-Deepa news-paper 22/Nov/2015."
Staff at the breakfast was very attentive and even remembered order of the previous day. Breakfast selection was very good!
Healthy food options were limited.
Ambience
"Except for The Lagoon, the service in all the other places was very ordinary. WiFi was useless. Response to any queries or help required was very poor."
I like the hotel services and staff. Food were very good and so tasty.
"I have noticed that, there is no Hand Spray in the toilet. As an European style that is ok but I have seen many of Asian people were stayed at hotel and I'm sure they might be had little bit embarrassed about that and also will be lead to the matter of cleanness of wash room."
"The breakfast is outstanding! But some of the services are not up to 5 stars, for example, I needed an adapter I had to call 4 times until I finally got it, no fruit in the rooms and the bathroom is rather old. But I heard they do a renovation in the hotel in the other wing, however, there was no noise which disturbed me. But overall the stay was ok."
We have stayed at the Cinnamon Grand many times and have always been happy with our stay.  The Location is excellent and Convenient for restaurants and shopping and the staff are very pleasant and helpful.  The hotel has a beautiful ambience and spacious surroundings....
"the location, and the fine dining restaurants keeps this property alive."
"we paid 900$ for 6 nights , and the rooms, are old, and they need renovation, and they gave us the old part of the hotel, which was not fair, for the price we paid, so it was definately not value for money ."
"Hotel was excellent. Swimming pool area superb. Service was exceptional particularly at breakfast, so friendly! Choice of hotel restaurants was amazing but a special mention for TAO restaurant where the food was stunning and service exceptional. Will definitely return."
Nothing!!
"First I want give 5 from 5 ***** to Mrss LEEZA for all great job she doing for guest of hotel    Thank you too much
All of hotel is very good 
"
Special food as you like and as you want I found this first time but not last very friendly staff very clean and calm hotel 
"Second stay here, the hotel for me is the best in the city of Colombo in terms of quality.Price is a bit steep considering your other choices however facility's in the hotel are like no other."
"Wrong room, the room details in booking is completely wrong.The size of the rooms are wrong and never updated, pictures are wrong.I booked a suite room, the pictured showed that this room is on the vip floor with access to seperate breakfast areas.In reality the room was in a different tower of the hotel, and was an apartment.I asked the hotel checkin staff Taniya to change the rooms and advise cost difference, never got a reply during my stay."
"Staff were very nice, friendly and helpful. I would like to single out Ms Melanie and Mr Brian of Front Office and Mr Nimal ( main restaurant that serves breakfast) They went that extra mile to ensure our stay was comfortable.Thank you."
"Connecting rooms is not a good option if the occupants are not family.Walls between rooms are of poor sound proof quality.Occupants in the other room were noisy so nights were sometimes disturbed and not peaceful ."
The staff was very friendly and the bed was comfortable.
"The hotel is old and that's noticeable in the rooms, decors and piping.  Also it's really business focused, I would not recommend for holiday."
"Breakfast was very busy but there was a good variety and service. There are many restaurants at the hotel, all very good, especially the Lagoon, the fish restaurant. We had a lovely room."
"This is our second stay at the hotel, and it is as good as the first time!"
Breakfast was a highlight in this property and the location its situated. 
The AC of the property is very old and it takes ages to cool. Also its really slow and doesnt cool the room entirely.
"The food at the Lagoon restaurant was superb and so was their service. Pricey but was well worth it because the food was delicious.   The breakfast spread was very good and lots of varieties."
The rooms were a little dated and needed some refurbishment.
we are satisfied what was on offer and the staffs are very friendly and delivered all services as we requested without any delays and also they have extended our checkout time late for free as well.
we had a two single folding beds for our kids and they are not that comfy.
"Staff at the property were excellent, especially Leeza in the lobby. Her welcoming smile and genuine interest in how we were was warming and really enhanced our visit. She is. a true asset! They really could not have done more for us and everything was done with a smile. The bed in the suite was very comfortable. Room service was excellent, everything was cleaned and tidied immaculately. Staff regularly asked if we had everything we needed in the rooms, even after completing a full room service. This hotel alone is reason enough to return to Sri Lanka."
"Given the size and prestige of this hotel, I do think that a children's club would be a useful addition. The area in Cheers is small, organised activities with a timetable would be great. Rooftop pool a little tired looking and was too deep for my nine year old (although there is an excellent pool outside though not as private as right next to bar area). However these are minor points and in no way affected our overall stay which can only be described as excellent)."
Heaps of fruits in the restaurant and good authentic food
The reception asked for passport or identification to register which I did not have; nor they informed me to bring one.  They were not very good and kept on arguing and finally I had to use my I phone on international roaming to pull out some e-mails.  Not friendly at all. They should have asked me to send a copy of passport via e-mail if they really need it. I stayed in a different hotel  two day ago in Anuradhapura without any harassment
Upon checkout Chamila in reception desk was so polite and act very professional
"Cleanliness was terrible, hair found in bed, sofa and every where. Dusting was not fine for months. Carpet with heavy stain which we can't walk without slippers. Found some pillows with heavy stain which they change after complaining. Bathroom was very un hygiene. Bathtub full of soap scums... very very dirty.... printing menus with lipstick marks and previous guest finger marks and food stains. Very unhygienic and dirty environments. It was a waste of money. Only named as five star but it was like 2 star hotel. I will never ever stay with Cinnamon Grand again."
"Dear all, all of staffs in the cinnamon grand are not friendly and not cooperative to the customer, we are the customer whether we are poor or rich the should be equal whether they coming any country of the worlds or if are black or white customer you all have to equal service. This was my first time in the cinnamon grand but I’ve been cinnamon red 2 times.I’m also working in the duty free and I’m senor supervisor sales so we are doing same thing and approach human being there want be any diffentsate to any customer to your shettur like 5 stars.I hope that wouldn’t happen in any country of this worlds. Thanks"
I will give full point those staying in the entrance door of the cinnamon grand and would like to say they are staffs they are doing good job cause any customer coming going through the entrance they will great in and out. I’m very much thanks for those staffs.
The hotel is a good place to stay. I wouldn't say excellent.
"The forgetfullness of room service about our meal orders. It's something to watch out for if you order room service and then patiently wait ! Remind them in about 15 minutes,not 45 mins like I did!"
best breakfast ever. the staff is wonderful.
"the wifi is so bad. didnt knew i would find so bad wifi in 2017. wifi was even bad in the lobby. jus all around the facility.and then one odd thing. they were putting up camera at the pool, is that legal?and then im pretty sure i was bitten by bedbugs.they did not change mattress, just the sheet"
"room 854 room was good in size but  room needed restoration . they were willing to shift me to the new wing but i did not . bathrooms in old wing were very bad . tiles and fixtures were old. overall polish was required. food was super so was the service. breakfast had large spread."
bathroom
"Great location. good breakfast selection, restaurants, staffs were super service friendly."
nothing I can think of. But my room rates were overly priced I felt.
"Great lively lobby with a nice lobby menu and a cafe to order from. Foods good quality and nice service. Reception staff very good, helpful and friendly. The lobby is great if you want to meet friends and family for a chat. Rooms are nice and modern.  The hotel is in a great location."
"the quality of food at the breakfast buffet was poor and the service was very slow and no attention to detail. restaurant staff including managers didn't seem to care much.good variety of food but not everything was good quality."
"great location and good prices at the ""coffee stop."" Overall layout of the hotel is good."
"The service is absolutely abysmal at the restaurants (multiple) and the ""coffee stop."" People have no concept of time and are just utterly useless. The hotel looks a little dated but the rooms are quite nice themselves."
We liked everything but had lots of hiccups at the checking in.  Had to spend lots of time to get it cleared.  Rooms without breakfast is a bit of a hassle.
Ongoing System Failures
Atmosphere was very pleasant and generally we felt as we were athome
Booked for three adults and the third bed was like a camp bed my six foot tall daughter had a uncomfortable nights sleep . They couldn't find another single bed for her.
Staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel offers great restaurants of different cuisines and spa with massage. Nice live music in the evenings and lunch time at the lobby coffee shop. Very nice experience.
"Deluxe room was quite small, but comfy. Good breakfast, nice pool. Beautiful lobby. Friendly and smiling staff."
"No balcony. Window view - on a car parking.From early morning 8:30 till evening 21:00 pm every day was an annoying sound from the parking ( like car alarm or something). Really makes crazy."
Nuga Gama food was excellent and the manager and staffs at the restaurant were very friendly. Apart from that the room is average. The room that got was facing the back of the hotel. There was no view at all.
The room wasn't what I expected
Loved the pool cafe and bar. The staff was super helpful and made the most amazing sheesha.
The rooms are small and suitable for 2 people only. We were 3 people in a room and they put an extra bed so the room became cramped. If the hotel doesn't have bigger rooms for triple occupancy then they shouldn't offer it.
Guest Services Manager Hashan Dissanyake and the two FD associates who checked us in were especially helpful; cake for our anniversary was a very pleasant surprise. Thank you
"The Concierge information: on two occasions, I asked about a restaurant booking at a restaurant on the beach"" ""Lavinia Breeze""; in the morning I was informed that it was open until 10pm and no reservations needed as it was a weekday; just before leaving checked again and was told the restaurant was open until 10.30 pm and no resevations needed as it was a weekday; on the way to the restaurant at around 9pm, I entered the name in GPS for exaact location and directions for the driver only to find out that the restaurant was ""permanently closed""..."
"Staff were very accommodating and a lovely ambience in the hotel facilities, restaurants and lobby. Food was of a very high standard in the restaurants near room service. Very nice decor"
"The room was advertised for 3 adults however there was only a double bed provided with an undersized folding camp bed for the 3rd person. Though the double bed was comfortable, the 3rd bed was quite uncomfortable and not appropriate accomodation for an adult in a 5 star hotel. We were disappointed with the 3rd bed and felt a proper single bed should have been provided."
"We have been staying at the hotel every year for more than a decade for its convenient location. Our room was in the newly renovated wing of the hotel, so the bathroom was nice. The room was tastefully decorated too."
"Service, particularly in the hotel's many restaurants and room service, tends to be lackadaisical and not in keeping with international standards for a 5 star property. Was surprised that the hotel didn't revamp it's technology -- no USB ports or charging stations in the room - these are fairly standard today. We will probably try a different hotel next year."
"Wonderful breakfast. Staff around the pool area very helpful. Great location, central to the fort area."
Triple room setup was slow but got sorted in the end with the help of a senior member of staff.
"Breakfast is super, bed is amazingly comfy perfect nights sleep. staff super helpful"
"I booked a queen size room but when I arrived I had 2 singles and was told the hotel was short of queen rooms. I asked to move which they did after I insisted, but made me wonder why they didn't Allocate the room I booked in the first place. Not a good start."
Its a typical 5 star hotel. Its got all the bells and whistles. We totally enjoyed this stay. Its got 5 restaurants on location so you are spoilt with choice. The breakfast buffet is fab!
Executive room and floor was a bonus - the lounge and all staff were fantastic. Highly recommended
Nothing - we treat with respect from start to finish

"Waiting in  the Coffe Stop ,Space is not enough for the staff to move even ."
Very poor customer service and the requested room was not given. Very bad attitude of staff specially the front desk girls and the hotel manager. Room had many issues and was not happy at all.
Location is excellent and the atmosphere is lively.
Had booked for a king sized bed and was given twin bed room. Also had requested for late check out with half day extra pay but the room key did not worked on the last day and hence had to travel back to reception for activating the room key again. This had been pointed out during check in but still the same happened again.
Same hotel that had a bomb blast! But staff was good to evacuate guests.
