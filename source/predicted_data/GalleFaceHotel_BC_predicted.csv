0,"The old colonial feeling. The whole buildings,  swimming pool, restaurants, the walk along the beach and hip vibe at night.",4
1,They don't have local cuisine that we wanted to have before leaving the country. The room is very small considering the value.,4
2,Loved this hotel! The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. The breakfast was amazing - probably 1 of the best buffets I have had.,5
3,It was very quiet but this was because of the recent Easter Sunday bombings,4
4,"Loved the enormous salt water pool,, and the breakfasts , especially the freshly made hoppers I usually sat a little longer with an extra pot of chai overlooking the sea,, nothing was a problem. And brilliant front desk and concierge service",5
5,"Such a lovely stay at the hotel. We arrived just after the terrible news on Colombo and despite having army personnel around the hotel, the staff were so amazing at making us feel safe and at ease. As it was our honeymoon, the staff upgraded our room and sent bubbles and chocolates to our room which was a lovely touch. The room service was also so prompt and tasty. Weâre planning on returning in the future to spend more time here. Thank you to everyone at the Galle Face for being so lovely at a time of tragedy for Sri Lanka.",4
6,"The breakfast was incredible, the staff beyond helpful and the bedrooms were lovely. It was a truly great stay and I would definitely stay again.",5
7,"I don't have a bad word to say about the Galle Face Hotel, we loved every minute.",5
8,The history is amazing and the place is huge and beautifully presented. the pool is great and th eoptions for drinks and food are really good. Location is also perfect.,5
9,Nothing,5
10,"Staying here made for a wonderful first night in Sri Lanka. A gorgeous historic building that has been looked after so well. Lovely rooms, incredible evening buffet eaten under the stars, a fun Cuban bar on site to watch the sunset and a lovely clean pool. Wonderful location too!",5
11,Nothing!,5
12,"Breakfast was very good and varied as would have been expected from a 5 star hotel. Bed was comfortablePool was excellent overlooking the sea - lovely to relax and hear the waves lapping. Staff were incredible helpful and always willing to help even organising a taxi for us at the end for the airport. We did not use the hotel's cars which would have cost $70 to the airport and instead used  Kangroo Cabs which cost 3000 rupees.",5
13,"For what we paid, I was expecting a nicer room. Although we got one of the cheapest rooms, we still paid Â£165 a night for a basic room and breakfast - with a view over a unused courtyard and building which had paint peeling off its walls.  We had stayed in much nicer rooms throughout our stay, but I understand that you are paying for the location and to stay in a piece of history. One night we went to the hotels Cuban restaurant, My partner is vegan and even though vegan options were given, the food was bland and tasteless and we ended up spending Â£28 for 4 small plates and 2 mock-tails. I would not recommend eating there!",3
14,"Beautiful colonial hotel close to the seafront. Wonderfully restored to its former beauty. Great spacious and well-appointed rooms, excellent breakfast and dinner. Superlative staff with great service!",5
15,"Perhaps a little pricy, but worth it.",5
16,"An amazing place to stay in Colombo- friendly staff, incredible food, plenty of history to enjoy in a place that oozes style and takes you back in time.  Definitely recommend it!",4
17,nothing- I wish I could afford to stay there longer!!!,5
18,The greeting was great the room was good. Complementary fridge and a great house keeper. Loved the salt water pool.,5
19,Holes in pool decking that could cause injury,2
20,The property is beautiful and the staff is amazing and they even bring you fresh water bottles and fruit in the swimming poll. The breakfast is great.,5
21,Rooms are old but well mantained. Could use an update. We had a balcony and what we could see: another building...,3
22,"This place is a living heritage museum, celebrating bygone eras. Staying here is a must on your visit to Sri Lanka. The building is beautiful and classic, the service friendly and helpful, the food and drinks delicious. I strongly recommend having sundowner drinks in the courtyard and watching the bagpiper play as the Sri Lankan flag is lowered at sunset - what a remarkable experience!",5
23,The hotel is an iconic place. So much history! En joy the historic tour of the hotel to get the best historic insight of the property.,4
24,Pity the harbour and big buildings are coming towards the hotel...,3
25,A wonderful hotel in every sense enhanced by fantastic staff. Colonial style with grand staircases and wood panelling. Staying here is a unique experience. There are plenty of marble palaces nearby but once inside you could be in any city in the world. The Galle Face Hotel is Colombo.,4
26,Nothing to dislike.,5
27,The staff. The welcome and check in process. Having complimentary minibar items and welcome snacks. The happy hour snacks were delicious. The ocean view from the room along with the sound of waves crashing on the property's beach. The outside seating area of the restaurants by the beach. The suite size. The TV was big.,5
28,"The hotel is old but not in a charming way. It looks like it needs renovation. The carpets need replacement (they look dirty), the wood needs polishing and the wall needs painting. Some areas of the hotel smelled like sewers and some of the towels in the toilet looked so worn out.",2
29,"The hotel is very colonial - it literally breathes the history of older times. It is truly one of the main places to see in Colombo, we highly recommend it for a stay in the city. We stayed for one night on our way back home and we really regreted not staying there longer.The staff are AMAZING - welcoming, helpful, discreet. You truly feel the luxury and the tradition of quality. This hotel is a city within a city - there are so many things you can do - 4 amazing restaurants, splendid front line sea view pool with salt water, bars with an exciting selection of drinks, spa area, museum (how crazy is that?!:)), wime cellar.. Special thanks to the manager who gave us an upgrade and a complimentary early check-in. We were surprised that the hotel managed to overcome our expectations! Will definitely stay again.",5
30,I liked the food. The burger was excellent on the veranda. We also went to the 1864 French restaurant and the steaks were very good. Service was impeccable and all in all a great experience and end to our holiday.,5
31,Curtains werenât quite fitting the windows which was annoying in the morning.,3
32,Huge room and you can hear the waves when you open the windows. Great breakfast and iconic sunset,4
33,"The hotel is a bit tired and our room looked like t hadnât been used in a while. The staff was very quick in fixing it, but We let we had better experience in significantly cheaper places.",3
34,Old colonial hotel with memories of days gone by!,2
35,"Our room was in a wing on the side, however the passage was noisy with people walking and we could hear doors banging! It is a beautiful old quaint colonial hotel, as such the floor creek etc",3
36,Have stayed here many times. The hotel has refurbished and improved consistently over the years. I can't imagine staying somewhere else in Colombo.,3
37,"The room was great the staff was friendly and professional. We had high tea with invited friends rather than dinner which was fantastic.
",5
38,Nothing. Everything was perfect.,5
39,"Nice, big hotel with history. Beautiful terrace to enjoy a drink. Breakfast was vast and lovely. Nice pool overlooking the ocean.",5
40,Our room was okay but not as beautiful as where we stayed before here. ,3
41,"Great location, just a few metres from Fort wall and beach with views of wall and beach from balcony. Generous and tasty breakfast.
Friendly hosts who kindly offered to do a load of washing for us at no additional fee.",4
42,Nothing,5
43,"An exceptional colonial hotel with up to the second amenities. Wonderful staff providing excellent service.  Great choice of food and drinks, a truly fantastic place to stay in Sri Lanka. ",5
44,If you can fault this hotel in any way Iâd be utterly surprised. ,5
45,Everything about this beautiful hotel is perfect. The staff are wonderful. The breakfast is superb and the atmosphere/buildings are excellent. I will always return here when I come back to Colombo!,5
46,The location right on the water is stunning.  It was lovely to sit by the pool and overlook the ocean and have the waves crashing right there.  It doesn't get much more beautiful than this.  It is also very close to any restaurant or site you want to visit in Colombo.  The buffet breakfast was also quite delicious.  The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.,4
47,"Galla Face is a total refuge from the chaos that is Columbo. Lovely setting and sunset views, kind and very attentive staff, very good food - breakfast will be an abiding memory of our trip. The hotel is old school elegance and calm. Itâs a big place but never feels frenetic or over busy. You feel slightly like youâre in an episode of Jewel in the Crown - a real experience and we were delighted to top and tail our Sri Lanka trip here.",5
48,"Honestly, not a thing.",5
49,"Liked the always helpful staff. The location was excellentTheir Fine dinning restaurant was superb",5
50,NOISE....late night loud Thump Thump music from lower floor ...which made me angry as on booking I specified a quiet room ..the hotel replied and said for my 3 night stay I would have a quiet room...it wasnât quiet at all. Buffet restaurant needs an overhaul on food selection and presentation.,1
51,Really enjoyed our stay. The amount of food to choose from in the buffet was amazing. Staff very helpful and friendly. Room was good and pool area very nice.,4
52,A room with a balcony would have been nice but overall good,4
53,The hotel was everything i expected. I was there for the Ironman race and i was welcomed the minute i stepped in the door despite turning up with my bike and all my kit. The rooms are great. The hotel is steeped in history and this is reflected in every aspect of the place. I would highly recommend it when you are in Colombo. I fell asleep to the sound of the sea!!,5
54,"nothing, i loved it",5
55,"Location, swimming pool, atmospheric old colonial hotel, with a wonderful museum over the history of the hotel. The sunset, the lowering of the Sri Lankan flag at sunset.",4
56,"It was a very different experience of living in old colonial hotel on the coast of a bustling city of Colombo.  I did not have too much opportunity to explore the city (I only saw if from the window of the car going to work), instead I took the time to explore the hotel itself and it was an adventure.  For those of you who enjoy historical places, this hotel has a lot to offer!  It is worth to talk to the staff members about the history of the place an some slightly quirky rituals that the guests will surely witness :).   Even if the hotel itself is over 150 years old, it offeres all modern facilities.  I greatly appreciated the fact that the rooms are equipped with old-fashioned ceiling fans as well as the air conditioning.   This way I had a choice not to use the later and still stay cool in the room.  The breakfast buffet is excellent with a large choice of diverse dishes - both local, Western and also some Oriental.   Overally it is a good hotel for those, who want to stay in a place which is differnet from the modern Western style business hotels.",4
57,"Beautiful old colonial hotels. Great facilities, lovely big pool. Nice pool bar and Cuban restaurant. Drinks quite pricey compared to other hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka.
Huge bedroom.",4
58,Silly light system all controlled from a key pad that you canât see in the night! Difficult to find a light switch to actually turn on! Air con was also difficult to use and so our room hot overnight.,3
59,"The ambience of the historic past, the building, the rooms, the location - all great",4
60,"Many groups of tourists, and the fact that the hotel misses a few âyoungerâ propositions - Cuban bar a good start... terrace area, long room can do with more of the same.... how can you make the hotel more interesting for younger  clientele?!
",3
61,"Again an old colonial style hotel . Rooms we stayed in were tired and a bit rough around the edges, I believe they are in the process of updating the rooms.With tax and service charge added on , prices for drinks, spa treatments and food were similar to western hotel prices. Nice salt water pool.Pool bar area good for watching sunsets, Sri Lankan piper announces sunset , and sri lankan flag  lowered overnight.Good breakfast buffets.",4
62,"Some mildew and fungus on wood in bathroom ,  manager told us  he would move us, but hotel full . Didn""t here any more from him and remained in same room. However they did scrape above off the wood !",3
63,"There was a fantastic welcome as we arrived in the morning the staff went out of their way to get our room ready earlier so we didn't have to wait until check in. Everyone was very friendly and provided fantastic customer service, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for making the start of my holiday in Sri Lanka one to remember.",5
64,"With a short notice, the hotel arrange to send me a vehicle to the airport to pick me up.",4
65,"In the check-in, the staff in the front desk assigned me  a room which is less than what I paid for.Upon bringing this issue to management, I was giving the right one.",4
66,Swimming pool and restaurants The Verandah and the Cuban by the sea,4
67,"Room was on 4th floor in one corner facing a tower with a soldier with weapon. It was big but old, bathroom had a leak. Old room old aisle.",3
68,Fantastic historic hotel. First class accommodation.  Pillows / bed great. View of property & ocean sensational. Breakfast buffet very nice.  Staff plentiful. Pool excellent.  Cheap tuk tuk to markets or shops in Colombo.,4
69,Canât think of any.,3
70,On the seafront but unable to swim in the sea.  Very efficient and friendly staff. Ok location. Access to many local hotel restaurants.  Complementary soft drinks and snacksin the room fridge. Hotel Cuban bar lively with good cocktails. 30m swimming pool with salt water. Spa and gym facilities good.,4
71,"No view from our room. Lots of building projects nearby, but this did not affect our hotel stay.",5
72,"Colonial grandeur - a delight to stay in this beautiful heritage building with such a rich history. Gin and tonic on the beachfront, a swim in the pool and a Sri Lankan curry buffet for dinner. Heaven! I never opened a door the whole time I stayed there. Staff were very attentive and friendly.",4
73,There was not a single thing to complain about.,5
74,"The staff were great, nothing was a problem. The breakfast is fantastic. The pool is clean and amazing spot for watching the sunset ",5
75,The lunch wasnât great ,5
76,"A historical and traditional hotel, beautiful place and wondelful property. The renovation is made very well, they have not destroyed the feeling of the palace. The room was big and well equipped. The staff is professional. We got very good dinners in the special restaurants and the selection of wines is huge.",5
77,"We had to wait more than half an hour before we got the room even that we arrived after 2 in the afternoon. They just forgot us sitting on the sofa. The buffetrestaurant is too big and restless, it was not nice to have at least breakfast there.",4
78,"We were very impressed with the check-in service. We arrived slightly early and were able to check-in after a short wait. The hotel is beautiful, in a perfect sea-front location and feels like stepping back into a long-gone colonial era. The room (junior suite) was beautifully appointed with two sea-view balconies, a feature jacuzzi bath and very comfortable bed.",5
79,"Unfortunately we were disappointed by the restaurant experience. We were staying at the hotel to mark a special occasion and I had made a dinner reservation at the Verandah at the time of booking. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were informed that it was buffet only that night (no a la carte) due to a private function in another restaurant. I felt the hotel could have communicated this at the time of booking, which would have given me the opportunity to make alternative arrangements. It also created issues for bathroom use as the usual bathrooms were off limits due to the private function, so we had to go up to L1 for the bathroom, which caused a further inconvenience to us and was disruptive to our special dinner. I felt the hotel prioritized the private function at the expense of other guests' experience, and I have to say this is not what I expected from this hotel. In addition, the buffet itself was not great, so what was supposed to be a special evening was a disappointment.",3
80,Love the location by the sea. Friendly staff. Amazing breakfast buffet.  Great massage at the spa.,5
81,Was offered a rubbish room with noisy road outside. I was upgraded after a little time so it worked out ok in the end.,3
82,"This beautiful, stylish hotel had no faults in my opinion; the restaurants and bars are diverse and excellent, the staff are charming and helpful, the building is magnificent  and even the small museum (housing, aming other things The Duke of Edinburgh's first ever car!). The museum also lists some of the previous guests at the hotel, including Cole Porter, Mark Twain, Noel Coward, Laurenve Olivier, Duke Ellington and Scarlett Johansson.  There's not much to be said for Colombo, so it's just as well that you feel like hanging around the hotel all day!",4
83,"We came in late desk duty were very curtious and efficient, bell staff were the same and then on top of that we were upgraded to a sea view suite wonderful way to wake up in the morning.Thankyou",5
84,Old colonial style atmosphere. Bedroom comfortable and beautiful.,5
85,"No view whatsoever from bedroom.Slow service in bar area during lunch time. Quality of food served during the various buffet services and the seating ambiance of the restaurant could be much better.",4
86,Despite being a large hotel the staff still make it feel very friendly. The fact that the hotel has its own seafront and has retained its sense of its history makes it feel quite special.  The hotel catering was excellent.,4
87,"The best hotel in Colombo, and probably in all  Sri Lanka
Colonial atmosphere,  perfect service, and excellent breakfast",4
88,Cost much more than the alternatives,5
89,"The bathroom was perfect, the room very comfortable, even had views. The pool and pool area was wonderful.",5
90,Breakfast not included. Otherwise there was nothing to not like!,4
91,Airport pick up service was excellent.  Beautiful breakfast on the veranda. Tried the Siri Lankan specialities.   Had great tea with pastries.,5
92,Our stay was to short.,5
93,"This hotel is over 150 years old and it is well reflected in the overal ambience.  For travellers who like hotels with the difference, it is a very pleasant experience.   Even a tour around the hotel is like sightseeing.   I also liked the location.  Right by the sea [althought the beach is not large], a great position to watch sunsets.  It is also close to a busy city promenade where you can immerse yourself in Colombo's life, so different from the slightly posh atmosphere of the hotel.Breakfast it very good.  A wide range - local and European food.  Very fresh and tasty.  Meals are served on the verandah which allows to feel the warmth and sea breeze.   Hotel has few bars, including a latino bar with life music.  The rooms have fans as well as air conditioners.  Fans are bit noisy sometimes, but for those who can't stand air conditioning this is a good alternative.  Staff is very helpful and patient.  Like everywhere in Sri Lanka.  Overall, definitely a very pleasant experience.",4
94,Sometimes I felt I was getting too much attention.   But this is just a cultural difference :),5
95,"Beautiful historical hotel that has been well maintained. The location, staff, facilities (especially the pool) were all fantastic and deserving of the 5 star rating. Thank you for such a wonderful stay. ",5
96,Nothing! ,5
97,"Galle Face Hotel is one of the iconic hotels of the past and lives up to its reputation. Compares to Raffles, Eastern & Oriental and Peninsular hotels.",5
98,My only criticism is that Colombo itself does not provide enough interest to support a lengthy stay at the hotel.,1
99,"Everything youâd expect to find in an historic hotel like this. Staff amazing, great facilities, room well presented and restaurants/bar good too. Enjoyed our stay!",5
100,"Unfortunately some ants had made there way into the mini bar, but this was quickly rectified by house keeping and the contents replaced (so not really an issue). ",3
101,"Iâm struggling to think of positives. The hotel was ok, nothing special stands out.",3
102,"The waiting staff were sometimes attentive and other times completely ignored you. It was really hit and miss. We stayed in 8 other hotels during our tour of Sri Lanka and experienced far better service elsewhere.
The food is overpriced and mediocre. Again we had much better food elsewhere on our Sri Lankan travels for less than half the price.
The pool is small for a hotel of this size and there are not enough sun beds.
The room appeared clean at first glance, but look again and you can see that the rug hadnât been hovered etc.
We could also hear noises from outside which disturbed our sleep.
We will look to book elsewhere next time we are in Colombo and I would advise you do the same. I couldnât recommend this hotel.",2
103,"Great location by the water, equipped with a gym, spa and pool.  Love the Veranda area! Love the breakfast spread! Service with a smile! ",5
104,If staying during the week of national day beware of parade and celebrations that result in road blocks in the morning til lunch time.  If you arrange for driver I find they themselves along with hotel do lot know how bad traffic will be or when Road will clear.,4
105,Very grand hotel. Historical features still in place. Good selection of bars and restaurants on site. Nice pool size which was not over crowded. Staff were attentive and well mannered.,4
106,"Noise from room above very loud due to wooden flooring and furniture if moved above and also noise in corridor travels very far. Room was small, basic and in need of a touch up especially considering the grandeur of the hotel.",4
107,"This is an historic and elegant hotel which is fully updated while retaining much of its historic character. It is in a stunning position right on the coast.  The staff are plentiful and accommodating, food is good and there are a number of restaurants to choose from, breakfast was an extensive buffet featuring european and Sri Lankan dishes.  We used the hotel three times as a base in Colombo on our trip and would use it again",4
108,"One of the rooms we stayed in, while having great views, was situated above a bar which played music late at night.  On the plus side, when we complained to the management about our disturbed night, they acted promptly to ensure that we were given a quiet room for our next night at the hotel.",4
109,Very good breakfast buffet. Helpful smiling staff. Good location. Easy to get passing taxis and tuk tuks. Interesting little museum with Prince Phillip's car. Attractive general areas.,4
110,Awful bare unattractive small room. Only one bedside light. Basic overhead shower. No bath. Tiny bottles of cheap shampoo etc. Room not cleaned by 4 pm so just obtained replacement towels from passing cleaner. Towels thin and frayed.  Bar food was served cold and soggy,2
111,All the magnificence of a grand colonial hotel. This property is well maintained with modern facilities but retains its grandeur & elegance.,5
112,Gluten Free bread was disappointing.,3
113,the breakfast spread was vast and really good! the view from the pool-side bar & dining is simply spectacular,5
114,"floor boards were creaking :) it was charming for us, not sure about the neighbors on the below floor!",5
115,Fantastic old hotel in excellent location. Comfortable bed in lovely large room. Overall the hotel seems caught between being an axclusive first class hotel and a mass market offer. Loved the sea views and the history of the place. Sense of fading grandeur.,4
116,Air conditioning in room could not be adjusted. Very noisy and much too cold. Bathroom ok but in need if upgrade to be first class. The hotel falls between premier and mass market. It would need an upgrade to be the former but is too expensive to work as the latter.,3
117,"Bar and restaurants were excellent,  especially the Cuban bar.  The love music the was fantastic!!",5
118,"Rooms were a bit dated, but designed to look authentic for time period. ",3
119,"Great food, good service, lovely historical feel of the hotel.Pool and location cannot be better!",4
120,"We had a very annoying check-in at 1am in the morning (room not ready and had to wait until 2am) - however, manager apologized next day",3
121,amazing views/location and front of house facilities - Restaurant/breakfast on site - Simply stunning !,5
122,The bedrooms ! very ol/tired and in need of a refresh,3
123,Iâve stayed there several times and always loved the old colonial style and rated it v highly . Vg cocktails and staff too,5
124,"Since last year I feel it had gone down hill . They kindly upgraded my room so no complaints but glad only there one night as view over back and roof tops and room nothing to pontificate about , so no major advantage ,whereas before I had a view over sea, front and Galle face green. Also little things like soap dish chipped in bathroom, lighting not great. Breakfast buffet deteriorated , choice more limited and had run out of emmental cheese which one doesnât expect of hotel of this calibre No idea about dinner buffet . Dined at Cuban restaurant instead but sad seaspray had gone. Overall seems a bit scruffy compared to my previous stays.",3
125,"The ambience of this place and the attention to detail was extraordinary. The Royal Dutch suite was truly luxurious with views over the water, and the complimentary chocolates to recognise wedding anniversary, as well as upgrade to access pre-dinner champagne and canapes in the Long Room, while watching a beautiful sunset was truly memorable. The swimming pool and pool service was second to none. The Library is well worth a visit too. Wished we could have stayed longer...",5
126,Nothing at all.,5
127,"Pleasant dinning, great staff, good location. Good live band one night.",4
128,"Paid for a deluxe queen room. Room was small,view of a dirty ally-way,and showed its age.,",1
129,"Colonial history, design and location. Cuban restaurant was excellent and great fun with excellent staff",5
130,"The evening we were there there was a major corporate event which dominated the main ding area and bar area. The majority of the terrace was closed to residents and the music was over bearing and far too intrusive.It is quite simply that paying guest enjoyment should be compromised in this way. We should have been warned and the room rate reduced as we were unable to use all the facilities advertised and the event took over the whole outside area.The outside bar area lacks atmosphere and just doesn't feel right when it should be brilliant. More thought is needed on the detail to create a truly colonial feel.I do not think buffet service for Dinner in the main terrace restaurant is what one expects of a international hotel. Bit like being at a Club Med resort.",3
131,"We had a wonderful stay in the Galle Face during pre-christmas time. A fantastic feeling in the traditional house. Scenic view, friendly staff and beautiful colonial style decoration. Love it!",5
132,"The room was a bit oldish decorated for such a traditional house it is a pitty. The food was average, with a bit too much Sri Lankan taste.",3
133,"The location of the landmark hotel is brilliant. as well as the history. The management is there poor. Rather uncomfortable for the lady travellers. No personal touch, no guest relation appointed managers we met. no welcome we have experienced. as much as we regret.",4
134,Location is brilliant as well as an atmosphere of the landmark hotel and the ambience. When service is missing....,5
135,The old world charm but still new looking.,5
136,I booked through booking.com. Reception somehow missed that I had alreadypaid for 2 of the 3 rooms Iâd booked and accidentally charged twice for one room. This could have easily been avoided if record keeping was done well. There was unnecessary hassle caused at check out.,4
137,Gorgeous heritage property thar takes you back in time. Delightfully luxurious as well and stunning location.,5
138,Canât think of anything other than a temporary mix up about our booking at check in. Communications between booking.com and the hotel shouldâve been clearer and more prompt.,5
139,Excellent location very comfortable and clean. Staff very accommodating. Colonial Architecture just Brilliant. Loved breakfast on the veranda. Drinks in the Evening at the alfresco Cuban bar a must .,5
140,Air conditioning wasnât working properly in our room however the technicians fixed the problem almost immediately.,4
141,Fabulous location and a very comfortable and stylish hotel.  Works as a place to relax as well as visit the city.,4
142,"The reception desk were a bit unwelcoming - it was sunset and the hotel has a tradition of 'piping' down the sun which is fun to view.  Our receptionist messed around and never said 'welcome' and we pretty much missed it.  Poor training for a hotel of such quality, but I stress that wasnt true of all the reception staff.",4
143,"Location - you can walk nearly to every landmark in the city. 
The swimming pool nearly at the beach. 
Choice of restaurants and bars (yet the speed of service could be improved, especiallly at King of the Mambo!)
Friendly and helpfull staff!
You should try the spa offer, especially the massage (ask for firm tratment and leave really relaxed)",5
144,"Room was rather loud, mainly due to not sound proofed doors, with a lot of noises coming from the corridor - source were guests but also housekeeping employees, active early morning (6-8 AM) - we couldnât sleep well
Bad smell as a result of humidity (in the room and some of the public spaces)
The price of airport pick-up / drop-off servcie is above average (even comparing to the Blacklane package of comparable car standard)",3
145,"Location is very central and unique as the garden is directly on the seafront (most other main hotels are separated by the main road). The swimming pool is spacious (40 m) & uses sea water. Direct view of sunset. 
Breakfast spread is varied and well presented. The common areas have maintained some of the original style of this historic hotel. Excellent clean & modern gym. ",4
146,Rooms Are a bit dated and would need an upgrade. Wooden floors tend to be noisy despite carpet flooring. ,3
147,Manager was not welcoming or service-oriented when receiving us at the hotel and discussing the room rates. Not the gracious service typical of 5 star properties.,5
148,"Facilities and decoration transport you to the early 20th century. Pool, restaurant and bars are well decorated and are perfect to spend days, weeks, months",5
149,"Elevators on the back section could be better maintained. Other than that, thereâs nothing else I didnât like",1
150,"Beautiful Colonial-era building, everything was immaculate and food was excellent. The whole look, feel and atmosphere was wonderful. Rooms are decorated in keeping with the era. Service is top class.",5
151,Room rate was fairly high but it was peak Christmas & New Year season so to be expected I suppose.,4
152,Right on the sea front. The building holds so many historical features and it is beautiful.,4
153,The meals and drinks menu is not clear about tax not being included so final bill almost doubles.,3
154,Good terrace overlooking the water for food and cocktails,4
155,Wasnât allocated the room I requested. The room smelled of damp and little concern showed by staff to resolve. Eventually I was moved but not without a fight which was a real shame.,2
156,Property itself was beautiful and the staff very nice,5
157,"Taxes are not included in the room rate or any of the menus, when booking this should be clearer as was much more expensive than advertised. ",2

164,Good hotel for our short stay in Colombo. Great location as very close to local Laksalas for shopping and to other tourist spots.,4
165,Room was not well-lit,4
166,A nostalgic visit had not been to Galle Face since 1959/60 or thereabouts. The resident historian gave a run down on the changes since then. ,4
167,Nothing to say all good,4
168,"It is  a great hotel. The service, the staff, the look and fell...  Everything is simply excellent.",5
169,"The only downside is that it is fits for couples. If the staying is surfing purposes, I would not recommend stay there (especially with kids - the hotel doesn't fit for kids).If you have honeymoon or just want to relax as a couple, this is exactly the place to do so!!!",4
170,"Beautiful setting, traditional colonial style really enjoyed our stay. Food and drink reasonably priced for this star hotel. We were upgraded to a suite which was amazing.",5
171,"Dirty bath, black bits in water when Jacuzzi was used ",2
172,"The hotel's charm is unparalleled. The location is unbeatable. Old world hospitality, lovely nooks and crannies across the property and lovingly preserved traditions. Great front desk experience.",5
173,"Still scope for improvement in housekeeping services, room upkeep. Hotel cab rates are way above normally paid around Colombo. Tighter management overall will help.",3
174,Great location and colonial vibe,4
175,Food at beach bar was very average. Chicken satay served undercooked and slightly pink. Staff very helpful and ordered again but still under cooked.,3

180,"Has so much potential to be a great hotel. However the building is run down, customer service staff have very little concept on what they are doing and at times rude and unhelpful. Food selection in restaurants was poor. Seems to cater for a primarily middle age British holiday maker demographic with pre purchased holiday packages.Also had an awful experience with some missing jewellery that had been delivered for us from another hotel. Galle Face have refused to accept any responsibility for this despite it going missing whilst in their care. We will pursuing this legally.",2
181,The British Raj at its absoloute best.,5
182,"It didn't bother us but seeing as a question about the beach appeared, you couldn't bathe, but it was no issue at all to us as the pool was magnificent",4
183,"Location, historic building and staff",5
184,Room description on booking.com differed to hotel website. We were moved after 2 days but made to feel as if we were complaining when we actually only wanted the suite we thought we had booked.,1
185,Itâs got great character and the restaurant is very good with good variety of evening meals. Breakfast was ok. Staff are fantastic. Beds are very comfy. Great location to go walking and exploring. Plenty of tuktuks outside if you want to go anywhere.,4
186,Itâs an old building so you can hear people moving around on the floor above which can wake you up. Room smelt a little musty or damp but nothing major. ,1
187,"Beautiful historic building. Wonderful dining. Buffet at breakfast was a great variety and huge buffet. English, Sri Lankan and to order eggs any style. Nice drink selection and pool. Wonderful place to recover during an extended journey. ",4
188,Our room was noisy from a wedding below us. (They moved us immediately no problem. Very service oriented). ,4
189,The staff were very kind to us when we arrived very early in the morning after a long flight and found us a room to occupy by mid morning at no extra cost.,3
190,Nothing at all.,5
191,"Loved the Long room for canapÃ©s and drinks in the evening. Breakfast was amazing. The staff could not have been more helpful. We had suites on the fourth floor overlooking the ocean, they were very quiet rooms.",5
192,Everything. Itâs a lovely colonial style hotel. With seniority and elegance. The Cuban bar is great. I will definitely repeat if I go back to Colombo.,5
193,"Nothing, everything was great",5
194,"We liked the Genius Loci of this place, the proffessional service, great breakfast, possition, the pool, lobby and the bar.",5
195,"We believe that the superior room we had needs refurbishing, it is quite worn out for a 5 star superior room",2
196,Classic old colonial feel. Really nice bar/terrace area,5
197,Rooms are old fashioned - not necessarily a criticism but some people might want a more modern bathroom etc,4
198,"Friendly, courteous and helpful staff. Excellent choice of food in Verandah restaurant. Breakfast was superb and bar snacks were delicious.  Good choices for dinner.Room very comfortable and fresh fruit offered along with free non alcoholic drinks in fridge",5
199,Nice grounds and beautiful old building.  In general staff extremely nice.  Buffet breakfast and lunch were very good.,5
200,"Booked connecting rooms 8 months in advance, upon arrival we were told the interconnecting rooms are small and unsuitable, ended up in two separate rooms and had to split our young children between rooms.  If theyâd told me that 8 months in advance I would have cancelled the booking.  Ended up being a disaster of a two night stay and they didnât seem to care at all.  Rooms are old and tired with archaic control systems.  Staff were nice but service was agonisingly slow even by Sri Lankan standards.  Terrible value for money compared to other hotels in the city, youâre paying for the history of the place more than anything else.",2
201,For historians a delight this old and famous hotel. Some of the rituals (such as an unusual ceremony every sunset) were very enjoyable.,5
202,"The rooms' bathroom needed some maintenance, but upon return to the hotel some days later all were very apologetic and a free upgrade was granted.",4
203,"The colonial charm of the hotel and its location overlooking the ocean, which was perfect for watching sunsets. Also, the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. A bonus was the quality and variety of food served at the buffets.",5
204,The room was a little small and there was a step up to get into the bathroom which could be a bit hazardous in the dead of night.,4
205,"Very comfortable as one expects with a 5* hotel of this stature. Lovely staff, quick & helpful at reception, excellent breakfast! Interesting to meet the gentleman doorman who has 52 years service with the hotel. ",5
206,"Some more sunshine would have been good to try out the pool, but nothing the hotel can control! 
",3
207,I am a repeat customer.  I find this hotel ideal.,5
208,"The beds in the old wing can be a little small, and the bathroom has a window into the room, making light blocking difficult.",3
209,"Beautiful views, friendly waiting staff and great breakfasts. ",5
210,"Noise. Wooden floors and noisy people in the room upstairs meant I was woken at 1.15am on the first night and a party until 2.30am on the second night led to bad nights sleep. The spa was a bit disorganised and deep tissue massage was not deep tissue and not very good. 
Avoid if you want to sleep. I checked out a day early and management response was pretty poor. ",2
211,As hotels around the world slowly become indistinguishable from each other this hotel is unique full of surprises and as helpful and friendly as you can be. I loved it and I'm coming back.,4
212,"Beautiful building, furnishings and setting.",5
213,"The noise of people in the room above (wooden floors).The service from the hotels booking team, who rather than honour their advertised get three nights for two deal which wasn't working on their website, just removed it.",1
214,"The breakfast buffet is incredible. The walk from the room to the restaurant beside the beach is fantastic. Very relaxing atmosphere in the middle of busy city.We stayed here for our honeymoon and the special attention they brought to the presentation of the room was wonderful. Great service !",5
215,"Beautiful colonial style hotel. Great wooden floors and historic fittings and furnishings.
Rooms are comfy with upmarket /old school feel. Pool is excellent with an amazing view of the ocean.
Location is great to get to some of the points of interest in Colombo.
Buffet breakfast has a great selection.
Also shout out to the pool bar staff who got us some buffalo curd and tikal even though it wasn't on the menu. ",4
216,Nothing really. Parts of the hotel exterior need a bit of TLC ,3
217,"This hotel truly lives up to its reputation as the finest hotel east of the suez. We checked in last minute, as an addition to our honeymoon travels and we were so glad we did! Amazing location, decor, staff, facilities and food. Would definitely recommend the Galle Face to anyone travelling in Sri Lanka.",5
218,"The building is fantastic. The hotel has really that classic stylish look.
Rooms are clean.
Breakfast is excellent.",5
219,"There is many staff around, however theyâre not that focused on service and creating that special atmosphere. Eg waiting times for checking in and out are much too long.
The area around the hotel is dramatically changing.
Hotel is slightly overpriced for what you really get. Itâs not that special experience I hoped to get.",3
220,"Staff were very friendly but not overly helpful. Swimming pool was amazing. The pool bar is also great for snacks and drinks almost any time of day. 
The building itself is just gorgeous. The galle face green is right next door and is a great spot to take in a sunset and sea breeze. 
The fort district is only a short walk and there is a shopping mall across the road. ",5
221,"The room wasn't as clean as it could have been. A pair of false eyelashes left in the shower were waiting for us the first time we used it. 
We called reception three times for assistance we never did receive. 
Price gouging when leaving. Don't ask for a taxi they will provide the hotel car for more than double the price of an actual taxi. Take an uber using the hotels Wi-Fi instead. ",3
222,"The whole hotel is an experience from beginning to end. Just walking around this beautiful hotel is like sight seeing in museum.  Their traditions such as the 6 oclock piper from the hotel to the shore, the two weddings we were lucky enough to watch.  All perfect.  Just one little problem.  The door between rooms (locked) did nothing to stop the noise next door.  We could hear teaspoons clinking, conversations, etc.  Luckily for us we had two considerate neighbours.  Not sure how that noise could be reduced.  Guess next time I would definitely ask for a room with no shared door.  However this is a beautiful hotel , on an amazing point of land in Colombo so make sure to go there (and ask for a room without door)",4
223,Only the shared door probem,1
224,"We returned to this fabulous colonial oasis after 36 years and it was more wonderful than before. The hotel is charming and is a reminder of a bygone era.  The staff are very much up to date about the importance of friendly, efficient service and are able to communicate extremely well with travellers from all over the world. A smile goes a long way and there are certainly many of those from the hotel staff.  The restaurants, bar, pool, museum and grounds are top notch and make for a very romantic interlude in a very busy city.  My husband and I highly recommend The Galle Face Hotel.",5
225,Leaving,5
226,"The location, unique
The atmosphere, timeless
The hospitality, formal yet warm and unobtrusive
The seawater swimming pool
And now the spa...",4
227,"Nothing, I am always satisfied with the best",5
228,We were placed in an (upgraded) room above thumping music that kept us awake. 'Just till 11.30pm' we were told when we called reception. Appalling at these prices! We had to demand a change of room in the middle of the night - very inconvenient. Never again!,1
229,Well preserved colonial relic ,1
230,F&B staff at buffet area needs to be more proactive; the young trainees at Reception desk need better training and improve on their customer service attitude ,5
231,"almost everything was perfect. the beach front location. the heritage elegant property. the beautiful artefacts. the gorgeous beach front pool bar. the little private beach. the creative nooks & corners ... overall a dream stay ! would like to mention the team members Sampath at airport, Lalith & Sajid at the long room, manoranjan on floors, dannika at the verandah, Amila the front office supervisor & Malitha at reception & of course Mr Sadique.  So many others I dont have the names. they create awesome experiences for guests !",5
232,"need more lights in the room and also light above the bathroom mirror. 
a lady at front desk called Nasheetha was quite rude & not helpful. ",3
233,"the hotel is the best place I have ever stayed at - the view from the room, the hoppers for breakfast and the sunset on the patio are incomparable - thanks",5
234,"This is a fantastic hotel for a splurge. Yes, there are more affordable hotels in Colombo, but you need a night here to experience all the Dutch colonial charm. The staff were so accommodating, great rooms, amazing food and a wonderful experience.",5
235,This hotel is full of old world charm and the experience was fantastic.  The staff throughout and very helpful and pleasant.  Great location.  Would definitely recommend.,5
236,The room was a bit small.  We had an ocean view room with balcony but the cushions on the outside chairs were filled with rain water and there were no towels to use the outside lounges (though they soon arrived when requested).  The fridge did not work very well.,5
237,"The hotel was in a great location and had a lot of charm,  The staff were great - especially those who welcomed us on our arrival at 3am!",5
238,Just outside the door to our room were all the spare beds/mattresses.  This was not a good look.,4
239,"Beautiful property which is built ON the beach, so you can hear the waves from almost everywhere in the hotel. So it gives you an unmatched resort vibe while still being located in the heart of Colombo city. They have preserved the grand heritage of the hotel very appropriately, we stayed in a 42 Sq.m junior suite with a huge private balcony facing the ocean. It doesnât get better than that.",5
240,"The staff were a little lazy. People didnât offer to help with luggage on both instances which was very surprising to me. The food also was acceptable but not a smack out of the park as one would have expected at a big 5 star in Colombo. Afternoon high tea at the veranda must be the most beautiful tea spot in Colombo. However the tea choices were disgraceful. Air conditioning in the room could have been a little more powerful, I suspect like most hotels they reduced the airflow between 2-5am.",4
241,What can one say about the Galleface Hotel that has not being previously said. This is an exceptional hotel and everything about it oozes five star. It should be on every traveller's itinerary to spend at least a couple of days at this hotel. We will be back.,5
242,Breakfast. ,5
243,"The room was very small and bathroom doors had problem. Not value for money. Had stayed here earlier, was given a better room. Not idle for old people and people on wheel chairs. ",3
244,Great spot great pool and nice bar and restaurant ,5
245,Not really value for the money you pay compared to other places. Concierge service not overly helpful,3
246,Balcony suite was wonderful & breakfasts excellent. Nanna wonderful breakfast manager,5
247,External paintwork was in a poor state especially front of building. Selection of drinks at happy hour in long bar was poor. If you are going to have a happy hour then make it a real happy hour otherwise I would have preferred to see the piping of the flag down at the main bar downstairs. Small front beach contained a lot of plastic litter that should be the responsibility of the pool attendant to clear every day. I picked up a lot but without a bin in sight all I could do was inappropriately give it to the breakfast bar attendant.,2
248,Wonderful old colonial charm to the hotel! Staff was friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious! They even surprised us with champagne in our room for our honeymoon!,5
249,The superior style rooms have very thin walls so you can hear everything in the next room.,4
250,The hotel staff were verry attentive. Great pool. The rooms very comfortable and the daily breakfast second to none. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.,5
251,"Stay at this hotel for a sense of grandeur and history. It feels a little like going back in time, in a good way. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was about the size of a London flat, and very comfortable. Everything was polite and professional.",4
252,No complaints.,5
253,Excellent location. Spacious rooms. We were upgraded to junior suite. Had a seaview and view of pool deck. There is so much history and tradition at this hotel. The small museum is a must visit. There is also tours of the hotel on certain days. ,4
254,Nothing not to like. Staff at the Verandah restaurant were so helpful but we ate at pool restaurant one night and found the staff unhelpful. They need to up their game to match the other areas of the hotel.,3
255,"Great room with a view, we were upgraded and also had a cake waiting in our room as it was my birthday. This was a very kind touch which was much appreciated.good location to have a drink and watch the sunset as well.Beautifully preserved features in the hotel, classic compared to many of the more bland modern hotels nearby.",4
256,"There was an event taking place on the chequerboard/area in front of the bar/restaurant and by the beach the night we stayed. We were not informed of this in advance or when we checked in and you could hear everything through the windows as our room overlooked it. That would have been ok as it finished reasonably early but the crew then started  to dismantle all of the props and metal structures that were in place for it. They woke us around 12.30 with the noise from doing this as they took no care to do this quietly. They continued doing this until after 2.30 am (I donât know when it stopped!) as I eventually fell asleep then (with ear plugs on!). I didnât ring down as I kept thinking that surely the hotel staff would see and hear what was going on. Also, they obviously wanted them to dismantle it that night rather than next morning so I donât think calling down would have made any difference as I doubt it would have been stopped just for us. It seems such an odd thing to do at that time of night in the first instance. If we had been informed in advance of this event, I would have asked for a different room.When we checked out, we werenât asked how everything was but I did bring this up and the manager was called. They were very apologetic and offered an upgrade if we stayed again but couldnât do that as we said we were leaving Colombo. They then gave us 2 bottles of water..It was a shame as it is a lovely hotel but due to being older, there is capacity for a lot of noise through the windows and under doors at night. I would perhaps return if I was in Colombo but not anywhere near the busier parts of the hotel and I do not think it is worth some of the rates that were quoted on booking.com (we got it last minute for cÂ£100 which was ok). We stayed in Paradise Road Tintagel the 2 nights before and found it much more relaxing, calm and very professional staff.",2
257,"Nice colonial propertyRooms were very spacious and well maintained despite its age Lovely sunset view from the terrace and pool Complimentary minibar",4
258,Nothing,5
259,The staff were most helpful and welcoming. The room was very well appointed and the views great. The breakfast sÃ©lection was good. ,5
260,The coffee was not good. ,4
261,"Beautiful colonial hotel; we stayed in a Junior Suite with an ocean view balcony, absolutely magnificent room. We ate in the 1864 restaurant and the meal was faultless. Thoroughly enjoyable 48 hour relax at the end of our holiday - weâll be back one day. ",5
262,Faultless but a word of warning - we were able to book an airport taxi for Â£4K (local currency) less than the hotel service offered - look locally!,5
263,"Beautiful building with fabulous salt water swimming pool and views out to sea.Lovely room with view over the Green. Good breakfast.",4
264,I was asked on way out if I was checking out because I did not come from reception desk. It was not a pleasant ending,4
265,Location was good.,4
266,The staff were not very attentive. Very inconsistent with training as there seemed to be no standard. The staff did not wear their uniform with pride.  I choose the hotel based on its history and location. I expected the staff to be better. Hotel interior needs a good refurb. I would not recommend to others as there are many better close by.,3
267,"The range of restaurants and their beautiful settings. Loved the location on the waterfront. Magnificent pool. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Beautiful colonial building and peaceful atmosphere.",5
268,Nothing.,5
269,"Amazing old property refurbished right on the sea. Hotel has a great history and a museum inside.Great central location. You can spend hours in the coffeeshop looking at the sea!!!
Mine was a short stay so i cannot comment on the food but looked like a huge spread .Excellent staff. Very caring. I fell down outside the hotel and was hurt. Quick medication and manager himself came to see me and called few hours later to ask if i needed anything. Bellboy   smiled in greeting when he came to pick up my bags even   as early as  2.30 am  in the morning.",5
270,There was nothing not to like..,5
271,"We were upgraded, so possibly not the most objective review, but the hotel itself is just beautiful, with the colonial architecture preserved and accentuated. The staff we excellent and the food (we only had breakfast buffet) very good.",5
272,The pool is sea water. It's warm though.,4
273,The hotel has a great atmosphere - really takes you back in time. Also level of service is very high. Great romantic place for a couple,5
274,N/A - we had fantastic time,5
275,"The staff at the reception is very rude and non-professional. But I only had bad experience with one staff. Other staffs at the hotel is very helpful. The hotel is has easy access to supermarket, shopping center and beach. Jewelry store is worth to visit. The breakfast at the hotel is good.",4
276,"Customer service. The hotel is old,  needs renovation.",2
277,"the hotel is amazing and walking in its big rooms and corridors reacalls you all the past of the hotel and its prestige. The room was big, confortable and very clean. The mini frigo was included with a lot of local products that we enjoyed either for the taste and as well for promoting national products. The staff was really carefull and nice altought they had lot of work as the hotel was full of people. The swimming pool was very big and the sun beds very confortable. We did not used the restaurant as we thought it was a bit overpriced if you compare with other options in nearby first class hotels and in any case that night menu was with international food and we prefered a more local option. But still it was very good looking.",4
278,"Is a bit difficult to find something that was not as we expected. Of course the price is a bit high for being in Sri Lanka, but it is still cheap exspecially if you think back to your country where a luxury hotel would cost half of my salary per night. We also used the pick up service at the airport that  was kind and professional but I found out that many agencies provide it 40/45 % cheaper.",3
279,"This hotel is a true gem. A historic hotel with ample charm and character , all brought upto date for a modern stay. Although there are many luxury 5* hotels popping up near Galle Face I couldnât imagine missing the opportunity to stay here.",5
280,The charm casts a spell that smooths over any cracks!,1
281,Gorgeous rooms. The pool by the ocean a lovely place to lounge on a hot day. Old world charm and a great central location. Treat yourself to a night here. ,5
282,Pricey but worth it. ,5
283,"Well located, comfortable,excellent staff,everything worked well from check in to check out,one of the best I have stayed in throughout the world",5
284,Nothing ,5
285,"Visiting the museum within the hotel. The sense of history. The cocktails in the bar. The flag removal ceremony at sunset. The very comfortable bed
The upgrade to deluxe side sea view :) ",4
286,"No bath in bathroom 
The muesli ",4
287,"The Environment, The Location everything is top of the notch.
The staff! They were unbelievably helpful, polite & generous. Everything is beautiful & elegant. ",5
288,"They added extra 30% of tax on everything without mentioning it. Even on Booking.com.
After I guaranteed by credit card (Non-refundable) the hotel & Booking.com said the fare excluded 30% of extra tax.
Even the dinning menu or In room dining everything is charged with 30% extra without mentioning. This is frustrating. ",4
289,"The overall ambience, location of the property, staff courtesy , house keeping is of good quality.The hotel is a very old hotel , has good history and is very well kept. The staff is mix of young and senior employees who are very friendly and happy to assist any time.",4
290,There is nothing i can say i did not like.,4
291,"This hotel is an absolute gem, one of the best in Asia. The look is classy and has kept its old charm but modernised the experience. Amazing staff are accommodating and the view of the sea is fantastic.",5
292,Nothing!!,5
293,"Hotel very old and made of wood so there are a lot of insects. Breakfast is the same everyday (staying there for 5 days). Staff chatting very loudly in corridor, impolite when answering phone call, and purposely avoid opening door. There is no washroom door separating from bedroom so it's very cold when taking shower due to aircon from the other. Soundproof is very low (wall is not made by concrete - tested after knocking). In room dinning options is very limited. To make the matter worse, the food quality is very bad.",2
294,"a perfect hotel which takes you back in time  to the british colonial era.A beach facing hotel , old style building adds class.very helpful staff and comfortable stay,",5
295,na,4
296,"The age, history and beauty of the place are clear. In its time and even today there is a certain opulence you donât get with a modern hotel. The staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful. The room is tastefully appointed and the bathroom had a beautiful hot shower with plenty of space. The bar staff near the pool were exceptionally helpful and kind, also they make fantastic cocktails. Sitting ocean side in the evening while the waves crash against the ocean wall with the warm breeze is magic.",5
297,The room I was in had an ant infestation. I mentioned it to the staff who told me it was an old building. I think the language barrier may have been a problem but I had ants all through my bed. If I put food down for two minutes sure enough the ants would swarm the plate. This made me very uncomfortable the first night but I forgot about it the second and third. Due to the age of the building and wooden floors the wood creaks and groans. The large doors at the ends of the corridors bang loudly and I could hear people talking in rooms far down the corridor or coughing at night. These little things are nothing more than an annoyance but it does lend to the age and beauty of the building.,2
298,"Huge room, great bathroom & shower, and the breakfast/lounge/bar areas looking out onto the sea front are brilliant places to spend time any hour of the day.Particular favourite was bagpipes at the flag raising/lowering",5
299,"Beautiful old hotel with a rich and interesting history which has bee very well refurbished.We loved looking out at the sea and it has a good pool area.",4
300,"The room was pokey ,too small with suitcases and only a place for 1 case. Our room was on the main Galle Face Road so rather noisy though it quietend down in the middle of the night.Please watch out for the local touts who pounced on us as soon as we left the hotel on foot claiming to be a member of staff and wanting to help us cross the road. We were exhausted and did not pick up on cues that we both felt we would have on a normal dayDo not use tuk tuks in Colombo just get the hotel to arrange a taxi.Maybe we just were unlucky but our day was expensive and unpleasant.....Happy to say we have met nothing but kindness since leaving Colombo!!",2
301,The Galle Face is a hotel full of charm and old colonial style with period furnishings but up to date facilities. The staff were all so friendly and polite and we absolutely loved staying there and would love to stay again. Breakfast was probably the best one that we have ever had  - the buffet had everything that you could wish for! At sundown complimentary cocktails were served on the seafront with canapes and a 'Beating the Retreat' ceremony by the Sri Lankan pipes and drums - simply fantastic!,5
302,Nothing!,5
303,"The staff were lovely, particularly the reception staff. Friendly, helpful, warm. The setting is beautiful also, just if they could tidy up around the edges it would be even better again!",4
304,"The hotel may be a heritage hotel, but that doesn't preclude good maintenance and regular updating of fittings! The food at the bar is also very bad, warmed up frozen food. Gym is embarrassingly small for this grade of hotel.",3
305,"Location, clean, good food, no pests, great laundry service",5
306,The bathroom flooded every time the shower was used & everytime we got it dried it was never fully dry,2
307,"Beautiful, old fashion style hotel - like something out of a 1940's movie. Location makes it easy to move around Colombo. Can eat in the hotel at the restaurants close to the beach listening to the waves from the ocean crash into the sand/rocks.",4
308,"Room was tiny and lacked space for a business traveller (even with an upgrade). There was a fruit bowl and chocolates left in my room (nice gesture) but ants had attacked and this resulted in ants roaming around the room on the desk, in-and-out of my laptop. Condensation problems in this hotel means clothes hung in room do not dry, but rather seem to get more damp with moisture, even with air conditioning switched on. Wi-Fi was exceptionally poor in my room. Almost unusable so I just gave up which was frustrating as my stay was for business. Gym is nice but way too small and lacks modern day equipment e.g. only 2 treadmills meaning a wait time which is inconvenient.",2
309,"I always stay here in Columbo. I like the staff, the views of the Indian Ocean, the location and the furnishings, but most of all the beautiful building itself and the sense of colonial history. I also like the pool and pool area on the edge of the ocean and - sometimes- glorious sunsets.",5
310,Nothing that springs to mind.,1
311,"I like the atmosphere, location and the staff's of the sea breaz. 
Front desk staff's too are really good.",4
312,"There were lots of noise near the room, minor staff's were shouting and gossiping near the room. (Cleaning Staff's)
Management issued us a letter saying that certain things are complimentary and on discount, but restaurant staff's are not aware about it. 
Person who came to check the mini bar was really rude, he ask the reason in delay in opening our room door.
Linen were too old, look faded.
",2
313,Such history!  The interiors are incredible.  Location is perfect.,5
314,"Im not a fan of Buffet style eating, otherwise this hotel is amazing.  There is another fancier restaurant though to dine at.  Despite that, I would still stay at this hotel again.",4
315,"Old world charm with modern elegance.  Staff were helpful, friendly and were more than happy to assist you in any way. Emanuel, the concierge, was passionate about the manner in which he approached his job. His assistance was invaluable.",5
316,"The Galle Face was terrific... Its position and history and old world charm. The rooms were massive, I'm sure we were upgraded to a suite - we had the best balcony (and I will miss the resident crow!)",5
317,One badly booked meal (fish) on one occasion at the pool bar.,2
318,The breakfast was very good and the buffet dinner excellent.Not enough choice during lunch.The staff were extremely helpful to arrange all the needs,5
319,"The first room we were given as an upgrade  was not in good decorative order and had a big bathtub in the middle of the room, which means it is not an upgrade in the old wing which needs to be reburshed.",3
320,The colonial style building and central location ,5
321,Our 3 teenage kids arrived into Colombo at midnight. It was 2am before they arrived to the hotel. Although we had already checked them in there was no bedding or towels for the 3rd person. I think a bit more attention to detail is important ,3
322,Location,4
323,"Went with the family. We got overcharged by the hotel. Staff and managers are horrible and they try to trick you once u check in and offer a free upgrade but then u realise that it was not free. Food is really bad. Rooms wr full of insects and ants, but they changed our room. Carpets inside the room are too old and stinky. And all that was fr 300$ per day. Never again.",2
324,The Galle Face Hotel is a colonial heritage masterpiece filled with all manner of colonial charm and ambience.  The 30m salt water pool was wonderful as I like to swim 2kms every day.,5
325,The cost of the driver from airport to hotel was very expensive.  The people that assist with external excursions didn't appear to be all that keen or willing to make much of an effort to provide assistance.,3
326,"Lovely Colonial hotel, great setting overlooking the ocean, a number of nice bars/restaurants in the hotel and friendly staff. Room was spacious and clean.",5
327,"The room was very comfortable for our first night in Sri Lanka. The hotel is beautiful, colonial style, with lots of 'hidden' gems (we stumbled across a museum storing Prince Philip's first car!). Service was excellent both at check in/out and in the seafood restaurant. Food was amazing too, very fresh and reasonably priced. Pool was clean and pool staff friendly/helpful in bringing towels, mats and drinks. Highly recommend if you have a night or two in Colombo.",4
328,Nice outlook,4
329,"The crows that flew around the property and into the restaurant, staff could have made a better effort to reduce their interaction with guest experience.",4
330,The fudge on arrival! Big pool and a lovely choppy sea view.,4
331,"Front desk staff - ignored us when we first arrived and then didnât feel the need to say weâd left sunglasses on the counter when we checked out. We were in a tuktuk before we realised and came back and the glasses were still sat there. Thereâs so many staff in the reception. Also the man managing the pool literally pulled sunbed mats from under people at the mere flicker of rain. They got wet when people swam so a little OTT.",3
332,I read a few reviews saying this place was a bit tired and shabby. That must have been before a makeover because it's stunning now. The spa is the best quality that you would find in London and the rooms are really beautiful. Great food and cocktails and not particularly expensive. The room is significantly more expensive than most places in Colombo but it's definitely worth it. You won't find this kind of old glamour anywhere else.,4
333,"We checked out a lot of Colonial Hotels during our Sri Lankan holiday and this one tops them all. Staff were so friendly and accommodating, my room had a lovely view of the sea, huge bath, the outdoor salt water pool was fabulous, and they even have bagpipes playing to take down the flag at dusk. Donât miss the chance to stay, absolutely a holiday highlight!",5
334,Service tax not included and not really clear until the bill comes. Otherwise no issues at all!,4
335,"The hotel is gorgeous, especially the newly renovated rooms. The second floor has amazing large balconies, great for evening drinks. The restaurants were also very good. All the staff were amazingly helpful and lovely, responding positively for all our requests. will be certainly staying there again on my next visit to Colombo.",5
336,"Room service can be a tiny bit slow sometimes. But if you're one a balcony enjoying the view, it doesn't matter much.",3
337,"As described, the atmosphere and the breath of history is really impressive. The staff, especially at reception really friendly, helpful and very polite, top ð",5
338,"I really cannot say, what I disliked. It is an amazing, huge hotel, where you can breathe history, kind of hotels, I usually like more, then these super modern hotels. Staff, especially at reception was extremely friendly and helpful, sure top class. But leaving the hotel, there was missing this wow effect, wanting to stay another night.",4
339,"Wished we had stayed longer to fully experience what the hotel had to offer. The building itself, and the staff were amazing. Bed SO comfy! Sadly we didn't get to have breakfast :(",5
340,That we weren't there long enough!,5
341,"Location is excelllent, rooms are clean and nice ",5
342,"Staff was impolite, room allocation was horrible, with two infants they made me change 3 rooms before the room that i had booked was alloted, happy hours manger was very rude and bad behaviour.",1
343,"This place is an absolute gem and completely worth the money - it will really make your stay in Colombo very special. From the beautiful rooms, variety of restaurants and gorgeous pool, this was an excellent hotel. I highly recommend it.",5
344,I had my wedding ceremony at the hotel and they went out of their way to make sure that the weather didn't dent our celebrations! excellent customer service and very friendly staff. The oldest/prestigious hotel in Sri Lanka gave the best service which is on par with the industry.,5
345,"If you like the movie Casablanca you will love the famous Galle Face hotel. The staff, service, and food are delightfully elegant in an old world way. The building and grounds are magnificent. We enjoyed the spa which is well run and clean. The food is one half English style and half Indian-Sri Lankan. The outdoor restaurant is sooo pleasant. The room was airy and spacious. Complimentary snacks and fantastic room service. Loved the experience.",5
346,Weâre sorry we had to leave.,5
347,Beautiful colonial style hotel great location... We were there on a Buddhist holiday w/e with wonderful festivities and lights around the city but no alcohol served anywhere when we were dying for a G and T by The Indian Ocean at sunset .. Which is why you stay at Galle Face!,5
348,"The GFH was stunning in every aspect, the food, rooms, pool. There is such a grand old-world feeling to this hotel. We loved everything about our stay.",5
349,Staff were really friendly and helpful. We got a tour booked for Sigiriya and Dambulla and it was really nice organized.,4
350,"This hotel is not worth the money. It is really expensive for what you actually get. The room is not that big, it has just a tiny window facing some houses roofs. It was really humid, all the clothes in the bag got wet due to the humidity and the beds felt like they were wet as well. Tv quality on the room was really poor, double image, pixeled... the shower wasnât great either. Really close to the wall which will make all the water get out of the bathtub while you shower. The room controls (lights) were like 30 year old. Overall experience wasnât great. Considering the amount of money we paid, weâre not happy with the results.",3
351,"We only stayed overnight after flying in to Colombo.The hotel was well kept overall.The staff were friendly and attentive. The room was a good size as was the bathroom. We had a nice view of the bay.The breakfast was substantial.",4
352,The bathroom had a fair few cracks and could've been a bit cleaner.,3
353,View was divine .. room great service excellent .. we loved the buffet and Seaspray restaurant.. we will look forward to coming back soon and wish we could have stayed longer,5
354,"Beautiful traditionsl historic hotel, so much Old Ceylon charm! Great bed pillows. Nice staff.loved the museum and the Travellers bar.",4
355,"The restaurants charge a fortune..we went to the seafood restaurant expecting top seafood, we had a cold shared seafood dish -  but it was tasteless and small quantity, service was poor had to ask several times for the waiter to come over...we were really disapointed.  Bed was also uncomfortable but pillows were great.",2
356,I was only like the location,4
357,"In the name of Gall Face I thought its one of the best place to stay in Sri Lanka, Finally I have realized that I have made the wrong choice. I would not recommend to anyone this hotel anymore and I will never go there again.I was there with my family for a short stay and I was totally disappointed about the food and the services that we were received, I paid about AUD500 Per day, but its not worth what I paid.Specially, there's nothing to eat in the buffet, most of them are empty, also, labels are  incorrect,  there are many issues which I could not wright here. And it's not good for the star hotel like this. hence its effect to the reputation of the hotel and to the Country.Thanks",5
358,"The view was great to enjoy your breakfast on the veranda. The food and service at breakfast was wonderful. Meal in the fine dining restaurant was just perfect. Staff very friendly, informative and helpful.",5
359,"Difficult to get to room on 4 floor, very confusing. Very dark in  bathroom to get ready, no natural light. Room on road side so a little noisy. Air con only effective if on high all night.Hit and miss depending on the room you get i think!",3
360,"Beautiful rooms with view on the sea 
Incredible location and amazing atmosphere 
Got upgraded to an amazing suite ",5
361,"Slow wifi 
Bad reception on the tv ",3
362,"Excellent breakfast, gorgeous views from the terrace. The pool was lovely. Generally the hotel is an oasis of tranquillity to escape noisy Colombo!",4
363,Room had a slight drain smell.,3
364,Amazing location...couldnât ask for anything better. ,5
365,Food variety could be improved. If they donât have enough occupancy they donât serve buffet breakfast or dinner.,3
366,This hotel has the best position in Colombo with a wonderful seawater pool right on the beach.  It has been sympathetically renovated with very comfortable rooms but still retains a nostalgic grandeur.,4
367,"This was our second stay at Galle Face Hotel. It's full of old-world charm, the service is excellent, and the food at 1864 is delicious. The spa is far better than it was two years ago. Overall, a great experience. We'll definitely stay here again.",5
368,"The breakfast could've been better. While some items were very good, others were rather bad. It's a bit of a hit and miss.",2
369,Staff were fantastic helpful and friendly. The breakfast and themed dinner buffet was excellent. The spa was amazing. I would recommend this hotel to others.,5
370,"Location and people Good , Breakfast Excellent and Chef was so co operative to support for Pure Veg Food and Guided us.",4
371,"Carpet very dirty , In Room too much ants .Though they know I am handicapped having walking problem they provided room is south block which far away from lobby and breakfast area",3
372,The location was great and the building beautiful,5
373,"I was told that I would have a sea view but was put in the back by the linen storage cupboard!  Food in the bar was truely terrible - samosas that were cold and rubbery and also a club sandwich made with stale dry bread.   Overall a disappointment. Some style but very little substance.",2
374,"Location is great. Hotel is iconic and well preserved.Nice museum.",4
375,"There is no beach.Very small pool.Crowd invade the dinning area near the pool once food is served. N Edâs to be addressed by management.",3
376,"Always a great place to stay in Colombo had a sea view room , breakfast was very good and as ALWYS the staff super helpful and friendly",4
377,Towels in room a little worn and no complimentary water at the pool as in previous visits,4
378,"This is a beautiful historic hotel that has some amazing features to it. We loved the museum and the restaurant, we also sat out at the seaside bar and had a late coffee, it was a wonderful location. ",4
379,"Amazing location, very nice hotel. The buffet was one of the best Iâve tried with an excellent price and variety. The hotel is well maintained. The staff are friendly, I had a problem with the WiFi and they took care of it in a few mins. Excellent place to stay. I asked them for a cake for a celebration and they had it in the room right on time. I definitely recommend it. ",5
380,"We returned to this hotel to recapture a treasured memory after having our first meal in Colombo there when we honeymooned in Sri Lanka 6 years ago.They kindly gave us a room with a sea view.  It is a grand old hotel and the buffets are to die for. We had breakfast both days. The swimming pool overlooking the ocean is great. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.",4
381,"The rooms are in need of a bit of TLC. Although we love the authentic vintage of this hotel, a little bit of sprucing up in the bedroom and bathroom would make a world of difference. It is expensive to stay here and the cost of food and drinks matches this.  We knew that when we booked so thatâs ok.",3
382,"The food in the restaurant was excellent and there was a good choice. The saltwater pool was large and deep, and warm!",4
383,"The room was not in good condition - it felt tired and some maintenance was needed on the towel rack in the bathroom. The smell from the drains was very noticeable.  More significantly, and what really ruins the hotel, is that the staff attitude to guests was poor, with an air of self-importance which shouldnât be present in such an expensive establishment.  The staff on the pool bar were lax and more interested in chatting with each other than serving. Very disappointing.",2
384,"Loved the property - beds were very comfortable, rooms were clean, staff very friendly and knowledgeable, enjoyed the 'club' room, salt water pool was nice. Would definitely recommend this to others - especially if they like historical things - restoration is beautiful.",5
385,Have no complaints.,5
386,Beautiful building and classic location. The wedding receptions are pageants.,4
387,"Synthetic - or, at least, blends - towels in the bathroom - which did not absorb water - and synthetic serviettes in the restaurant. Resupply of the room was a bit erratic. Food was okay, but not great.",3
388,Great location and really nice staff and wonderful ambience!,5
389,Could have been more chairs in the room. Only one. Or other places to put clothes. Bad towels.,1
390,"Wow, from the moment you walk into Galle Face Hotel you know that you are in for a good stay. An incredible old building in immaculate condition with friendly staff and great facilities.",5
391,"Helpfulness if staff. Celebration day on 15/4 was lots of fun with drummers, dances & games. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Chef Brian was cheerful & happy to explain all about Sri Lankan foods.",4
392,Making a mistake - my partner & I both accidentally made a booking each. The hotel upgraded ð¤us one night at our request but no cancellation â¹ï¸,1
393,"Owners did a great job of maintaining the history and heritage of the property, while also providing modern comfort. There are small niggles (minor fit and finish issues, leisurely response to some requests) - but would recommend to take it as part of the charm. The gentleman hired to scare off crows with a slingshot outside the breakfast place is a remarkable anachronism.",5
394,"Request to set up an extra bed took half an hour and a reminder before it got done. There were minor imperfections in the room (slightly askew hole covering the ceiling, rattling bathroom fittings).",4
395,"To be honest: We read a lot about it and were a bit sceptical but the Galle Face hotel surpassed our expectations!
Beautiful wooden floors, breathing history in every corner, very friendly and helpful staff, located right by the Indian Ocean, amazing breakfast, clean and well air conditioned rooms, very nice and long saltwater outdoor pool!
Like we said in the title: A perfect place to stay your first few days when you arrive in Sri Lanka",4
396,Only negative point is that from the hotel you have to look at the Harbour being build opposite the hotel ruining your view!,5
397,"Excellent staff; the breakfasts were lovely and the rooms extremely comfortable and well appointed. The pool was fantastic and loved the location at the far end of the Galle Face Green. Made for a pleasant stroll into the Fort area. I had trouble checking in for flights on my mobile and was able to use their business centre to do so and print my boarding passes. The common areas are also very beautiful, you can really feel the history in the hotel without it being run down. Room service was excellent in quality and delivery.",5
398,"My experience in the spa was horrible (that being said, my sisters was fantastic and they did offer me 15% off my service based on the feedback they asked for right after the treatment, even though I didn't ask for any compensation). I found the buffet dinners at the Verandah the two nights we went (Japanese and Indian) to be OK but overpriced for what they were. Unless you are a big eater, I would go with a la carte.",5
399,The staff were extremely helpful. I liked the free minibar despite no alcohol in it. I loved the building the history and the museum. It had some great pictures throughout the hotel. It was a great last hotel of our holiday. We were treated very well.,5
400,View of the docks and ufgly buildings that now surround it.,4
401,Location & ambience,5
402,"Financial discipline. I was charged double for my room. A pre authentication of $ 250 was excess charged to my credit card instead of cancellation of the pre authentication.This is unexpected for a booking through Booking.com. We will lose confidence on the site if this continues.",1
403,Local Sri Lankan food at Dinner and Breakfast was excellent.,5
404,"Unfortunately not the best place for a woman travelling alone. Before 8 am in the morning, a male staff member unlocked and entered my room while I was in the bathroom. After I spoke out, he quickly backtracked and I confronted him in the hallway outside to query his presence in my room. His excuse was to do my laundry, which had not been requested, and why would that require room entry anyway? Next, during breakfast in the Ladies Washroom downstairs of the bar area, a male staff member stood grinning in the doorway as I came out of a cubicle to follow me (dressed modestly in long sleeves and long skirt) to the stairs making suggestive remarks. Although the Hotel Manager expressed concern about the incidents, sadly I will not consider to stay again alone in this place.",3
405,"This is the only place to stay in Colombo. Directly on the beach in an iconic area. The hotel has had a magnificent make over. Old world charm overlain with everything that you would expect from a 5* hotel nowadays. Lovely wooden floors and large, well equipped spacious rooms. The hotel staff were lovely and very helpful. The food was excellent and the most amazing breakfast. The salt water swimming pool was a treat and watching the sunset in the grounds and the piper piping down the flag at the same time was a treat.",4
406,Nothing,5
407,"Lovely old hotel with lots of charm. I would stay here again for a day or two en route somewhere else in Sri Lanka, as this is (in my view) a transit hotel not a holiday location due to no beach. Ask for room 2044!",3
408,Reception and check-in staff. Delayed our check-in by 30 mins and tried to put us in a room that was lower than the standard we had paid for. This started our stay with a bad feeling about the hotel. Staff are good but could be better.,3
409,The breakfast was the best I had in Sri Lanka. Nice big room.,5
410,Very expensive. For this price they should include an airport shuttle at least. Also the hotel taxi driver overcharged me for a very short journey. Avoid them and use the tuk tuks.,3
411,"This a great old colonial property, essentially modernized, with a convenient setting in the center of the city.  The facilities were beautiful and well-maintained.  We stayed in the premier balcony rooms and enjoyed a spectacular view, a comfortable room, and access to an open-bar happy hour.",5
412,"This is not a perfect 5 star top-class hotel; the staff can be a little erratic, and the rooms have some wildlife and history despite their refits.  If you expect 5+ star perfection, this may not not for you, but if you have a little patience and enjoy some quirk with your heritage, it's a wonderful place.",5
413,The breakfast buffet is fabulous and the attention to detail by the front office staff and concierge is wonderful.,5
414,"The service in the Traveller's Bar was chaotic. wrong drinks delivered, drinks missing.  Needs attention.",2
415,"Loved it. We got a good rate so perhaps not the best room so we didnât have a balcony (which is hard with young kids) but hat was our mistake! Museum, library and pool all great facilities. Also absolutely loved the fine dining restaurant bar",5
416,Location and hotel are amazing. Graceful colonial building in original style. Hotel is adjacent to Gale Green and walking distance to Dutch hospital shopping area. On site food is good and reasonably priced.,5
417,"Service is hit and miss. To give an example (could give more) ordering a cab at the reception was a painful undertaking where I was sent by reception, to concierge, to an empty taxi stand to a porter who sent me back to reception where I was asked to call myself. Typically upmarket hotels canât arrange a taxi for their guest. Not here (unless you take the overpriced hotel taxi).",2
418,"The hotel has been beautifully brought up to date keeping the gentle ambience and features of the old hotel, combined with the comforts of modern living. Everything you need and more. Staff were efficient and very friendly - nothing was too much trouble. ",5
419,The only thing wrong was that we didnât stay long enough. ,5
420,"Fantastic historical hotel, renovated not too long ago. Beautiful building with very nice historical details. Great service and very good restaurant. The bar outside is amazing with sea view. Favorite hotel in Colombo",4
421,Beautiful heritage building near the ocean,5
422,"Small room. Poor wifi which kept getting disconnected, mould in the bathroom edges, air conditioning died in the middle of the night. wake up call late by 30minutes!",1
423,My wife and I were treated like royalty!  Every detail was properly taken care of with excellence.,5
424,"I see my settings on Booking.com must be wrong.  I am an American, but this review states that I an Sri Lankan!  Never mind who I am, the stay was exceptional.",4
425,The hotel is run with efficiency and professionalism geared towards the comfort of guests.  The rooms are spacious and well-serviced and the staff strike the right balance between attentiveness and respect for your personal space.,4
426,The menu at the restaurant would benefit from the inclusion of more sophisticated dishes in both Sri Lankan and European cuisine.,5
427,The staff were wonderful in particular Kumar who looked after us in the long room. The swimming pool was well run and staff were accommodating in trying to find you a space at busy times. The gym although small did the job and the personal trainer there was a gentlemen. House keeping staff were friendly and accommodating also. Overall I was very impressed and I would definitely stay here again.,5
428,I didnât dislike anything,5
429,"Beautiful and recently refurbished hotel. Excellent location, food and good service. One of a kind really. ",5
430,"Arrogant and condescending front desk staff. Extremely unhelpful during check in and reluctant to give a warm welcome. When asked to extend stay they said this was only possible at a fee of 380 USD which is a shame as later that day we got notifications of booking.com offering rooms at 100 USD. This really gave a negative twist to our overall stay.
The fact you cannot pull up in a tuk tuk is ridiculous. This is Sri Lanka and not Monaco - please get a grip. 
With the ongoing real estate project on the west side of the hotel the view will soon be that of any major city and thus be ruined. I think the atmosphere the hotel boasts will be totally gone as Colombo is getting to ready to be the next Dubai.",3
431,The hotel has a wonderful history and is located very well.,5
432,"The windows on the side of our room were filthy. The blinds were pulled down on that side and the cleaners ignored the windows behind, like for years. The bath was also not clean and when you turned on the jets, loads of black gunk came out. The staff were generally quite snooty and were not overly keen to provide good service.In general the hotel is a little tired and very over priced.",2
433,"Staff was very friendly and prompt supporting (especially Mr.Manoj). I travel once a yr to Colombo for biz, this is the 1st time to Galle Face and for me it has the best compromise quality/price.",4
434,"The hotel has a rustic feel to it, it has character, and at the same time provides all the modern facilities. Right on the sea, views are great.",4
435,"service in the restaurant was not always efficient, waiting to be serviced",4
436,"We always stay there. Everything works, the food id great, the position unrivalled, and you can't beat the retro-Imperial chic of the Real Thing. Also, the gym's been fixed with new kit.",4
437,Nothing,5
438,"Beachfront, colonial charm.",5
439,"Surly staff, the only hotel we stayed at where the welcome was indifferent. When the power failed 0630 as we were leaving, we dressed in the dark and were unable to use hairdryer, manager said it was my fault for not having reported it, despite it being quite inappropriate for a workman to be in our ( 2 females ) room as we were dressing and packing for an early airport departure. no apology. Poor service, no hand towels or dryers in the hotel loos.",1
440,"For our final stop in Sri Lanka we chose to stay in a nice room in a nice hotel and picked the Galle Face Hotel.  We had a junior suite with a private balcony and lovely spa bathtub.  It came with breakfast and free happy hour drinks (which we sadly couldn't take as much advantage of as we would have liked).  Not a cheap place to stay, but very luxurious and would have been nice to stay another night or two.  We were delighted to find the hotel had a library - and amused to discover the museum.  It is a charming colonial hotel and the most formal place we stayed at in Sri Lanka.",4
441,Many coastal places have seagulls - Galle Face Hotel has crows and they will steal the food off your plate if you're not careful!  They also went after my hair a couple of times.  One of the restaurants has someone employed to shoo them off with a laser pointer which was somewhat effective.  Occasionally the air conditioning was a little fierce.,3
442,"Was a lovely stay the staff were lovely particularly Shiraz on reception he was very very helpfulLooking forward to returning again soon. Bedroom was lovely, excellent shower and very comfy beds.  The breakfast choice was exceptional",5
443,We liked everything,5
444,Location is by far the best among all other hotels in Colombo.,3
445,"Interior of the room is old could have been updated.  I am sure there are better rooms at higher prices.  However, there are far better and newer hotels with better services are available at better prices.  This hotel is betting on the past fame than the actual current state of the hotel.",2
446,Watching the sunset from the bar and the piper piping down the flag is very moving.  Hotel has teal style.  Great free mini barwell stocked.  Comfy bed very relaxing,5
447,"The Agatha Christie atmosphere, location, food, staff come from another world, unfortunately passed away...",5
448,"Who cares ?...you don't want it to be perfect..",5
449,"I stayed at GF twice. The first time I was lucky to be upgraded to a suite, where i was lulled to sleep to the sound of crashing waves.  The second time was in a beautiful room too.  I enjoyed leisurely buffet breakfasts......so many choices. thank you.",5
450,Another very enjoyable stay at the GF. Love the old world charm and the packed breakfast box kept us going on an early long railway trip. Very thoughtful.,5
451,Nothing. Staff used to be a bit offhand but no longer all were really helpful. A good couple of night's stay.,4
452,"Great location, property beautifully restored",5
453,Rooms are small and service is extremely slow in the restaurant. My sorbet came to me in a slopping mess after having had to wait nearly half hour for it.,2
454,Great setting and heritage.,5
455,Our room had no view. So check before booking. The car service based in the hotel turned out to be by far the most expensive we used while in Sri Lanka.,2
456,"We stayed at the GF on the first night of our trip to Sri Lanka and loved it so much that we decided to stay on our last night as well. Perfect welcome from staff, who were kind enough to upgrade us so that we could be closer to the pool, a cuddly toy for our new baby, beautiful room with Jacuzzi bath, delicious dinner and breakfast. Can't recommend highly enough.",5
457,"I have never been so inspired by anywhere quite like the Galle Face Hotel.Itâs rich in history, incredible art works, the hotel decor is so classic, yet warm and inviting. It uses a range of textures, fabrics, woods and colours. The people who make the Galle Face so inviting with their warm smiles.The day spa was exceptional.Highly recommend.",4
458,Old colonial building,5
459,"I was arriving early morning. To make sure that I do not encounter answer like: check in time is after 2 my room was paid from day before... well it was not ready! Of course I protested and made sure they read the reservation again. It took over an hour to clarify that. Honestly it should not happen. Then I was given far inferior room with dirty windows overlooking parking, for a short period. I moved to my room early afternoon. They should take off one night from my bill at least for that kind of service!!!! NO, they did not! So not such a great experience. I could stay in Shangrila just across where I have high status, I loved the look of the Galle Face...",2
460,"Bathroom is good, great water pressure. Great food and dining. Beds great. Itâs a lovely hotel.",5
461,We had to move a lot as we wanted and paid for 2 rooms which were not provided.. took a while to get the correct rooms.,3
462,"We had a spacious comfortable room. The restaurant on the verandah serves varied buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner. At sunset, the flag is lowered by an official accompanied by a bagpipe player in kilt. Good salt-water pool.",4
463,"We really loved our stay, in particular the decor and the ambience! Perfect location as well!! The breakfast was simply delicious! Very nice also the entrance and the first floor common areas!! Relaxing and fully of charme!",5
464,"The room was quite small, but this was part of the charme and we do not see it as a negative point! We would definitely come back!",4
465,"Large room and bathroom,very clean.No terras but the window can be opened. Staff very friendly. Beautiful spa, not cheap.",4
466,Swimming pool is with salt water.,5
467,"I knew this was a hotel with a reputation but I genuinely didn't expect to be as blown away by it as I was. Gorgeous, grand place. We tried the seafood restaurant and it was lovely. A holy day so no alcohol design at the bar but still a glorious place. If you have the ability walk up and down the stairs rather than use the lifts. Even the atrium areas are amazing!",5
468,Nothing!,5
469,The communal rooms were great...fantastic old colonial feel. Our room had a great view.,4
470,The lighting was rather dim and the towels etc in the bathroom in short supply...,3
471,Overrated.  A very old hotel that does a poor job with soundproofing. Woke up when someone above my room started his morning prayers with a loud speaker.,1
472,The room is very comfortable and the complementary mini bar facility we enjoyed. Breakfast had a vast spread of food and delicious. Hotel staff is friendly and supportive.,5
473,The pool has no shallow end so a person who can't swim better can't enjoy the salt water pool. No view from the room.,5
474,"Great location and the service was friendly if slightly slow. My big comment was that we ate at 3 restaurants, the Verandah, the Sea Spray and 1864. The Verandah and Sea Spray were excellent, see below for the 1864.",4
475,"1864 was poor actually. Service was fine although it took an age for the wine to arrive as they had to get it from Sea Spray, but the food was far too western in a country with so much wonderful food. It was also empty on a Saturday night probably because of that.",3
476,Lovely room (in spite of being street-side (still not too noisy). Excellent fish restaurant (Sea Spray) looking over Indian Ocean) British Raj-type architecture  in wonderful setting.,5
477,"Staff (especially at buffet restaurant in evening) slow and lacked a welcoming smile (otherwise the key feature of Sri Lankan hospitality). Had problems and delays with correct billing for what we ate (nobody explained the computer was down!) ...not the best experience in our jetlagged state, so sadly we were left feeling the ""raj experience"" was a bit wanting.",2
478,"The room (2044) was big and comfortable. It included breakfast and evening drinks + canapÃ©s in the Long Room; very quiet with personal service. Food was excellent. The hotel itself is a classic example of British colonial architecture, a welcome change from the usual 5-star places.",5
479,Pool a bit small; limited space which could get crowded.,4
480,"A lovely old colonial building, directly on the ocean.We loved sitting in the garden, watching the sunset.Food was excellent and very tasty, the SPA area a bit too coldbut worth a visit. Go and see the little museum.",4
481,"A horrible construction zone is spoiling the view. Investors are building an island  right infront of Galle Face, call it Harbour city, with skyscrapers, Dubai style for many people. It is very very sad and will destroy the charme of the whole area.",3
482,"Really excellent service, fantastic breakfast!",5
483,"Not the hotelâs fault...I feel sad  that there is a huge construction project underway, north of Galle Face Green. It doesnât spoil the sunset view and some people who love building things will be fascinated, but it is constrast with this lovely hotel!",5
484,"The hotel is very classic - colonial style but the rooms are well furnished and modern. We received a free upgrade to a suite, which was fantastic. The breakfast buffet has a nice spread of Western and local fare.",5
485,Milk Toffee on Arrival was a very nice touch.  The in house museum and library gave a great sense of history of the hotel along with the painting and photographs of the hotel in its past glory.  The Breakfast buffet was amazing.  The Lo'ocitane spa was fabulous!  In particular the  grounds facing west are a great spot for a drink whilst watching the sun go down.,5
486,"On check in we were told our room would be affected by noise.  when we requested to be relocated they were quite reluctant to do so, but in the end accommodated our request.  A very minor blemish on what was a great stay.",4
487,Colonial style. Location - listening to the waves break enjoying a drink/dinner. Excellent level of service. Sea Spray restaurant - great venue and great food.,5
488,Hotel can feel a bit tired - but it is part of its colonial charm and heritage.,3
489,"The room was perfect, with an amazing view to the sea and sunset, a very comfortable bed, and a lovely bathroom. The swimming pool is beautiful - cool salt water.",5
490,"It was wonderful to live in a museum for 2 days. It looks amazing in the lobby, restaurants, library,  and the museum.",5
491,"Unfortunately our room (4006) was a disappointment, the light was very unpleasant, the bathroom needs an urgent renovation (smells like mold), and the towels are grey instead of white.",2
492,It's not like a modern 5 star but it is well compensated by its caracter. Good breakfast but average coffe. High tea was excellent.,4
493,Not enough sun chairs at the pool. Only one hanger for bath towels is a bit annoying.,4
494,Fabulous and personalized attention. The hotel has a lovely view of the Indian Ocean with really nice sunsers. In the restaurant  they serve a buffet with different types of food every day. Always delicious.,5
495,I liked everything.,5
496,"Great location with stunning views, and nice food. ",5
497,"2 small things: Limited activities - which suited us, to be fair - and there were a lot of staff just sort of loitering around, which was mildly off-putting. 
",3
498,Beautiful colonial building with wonderful sea views. Staff very friendly and the 1864 hotel restaurant was fantastic - best steak we've had in months.,5
499,The service could be very slow at times and the little touches you expect from a five star hotel were missing.,4
500,"This is simply a great hotel. It is old - 1860s -  but beautifully renovated. It is right on the ocean front and a 15-20 walk to the Fort area of Colombo. The seafood restaurant is superb. Great service, large comfortable and clean rooms, excellent public area inside and outside. Why stay in other hotels that cost as much or more when you get such character at the Galle Face.",4
