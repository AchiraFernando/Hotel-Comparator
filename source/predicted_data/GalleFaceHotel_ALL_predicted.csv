0,"First hotel on our visit of Sri Lanka. We arrived at 1:30am, check-in was smooth and we were given a nice room. ,However the next day we opened the terrace door to a wall rather than an ocean view we were expecting. A quick word to the front desk and we paid to upgrade to a much better room with a great sea view,The staff were nice and the hotel facilities are good considering the hotel is one of the oldest in Colombo,The best part of the hotel is definitely the Cuban bar âKing of the Mamboâ ",4
1,"Stayed in Galle Face 2 weeks before the terror attack in Colombo ( Saddened so much to hear after having such a wonderful time)...It is absolute rude shock. Coming to the hotel, probably one of the best hotel with old British style. One has to stay and experience if you are a lover lovely wooden furniture still you feel in 5 star hotel. It has got one of the beautiful private beach...with elevated view. Food is awesome. You get best of the decent yet attractive night clubs. Enjoyed swimming pool just above sea level...you feel you are in a beach yet in swimming pool. Worth the every penny you spend. It is also a good family destination.",5
2,"Beautifull colonial hotel on the beach, full of historical moments of Colombo, bar and dining are amazing and just to have a breakfast in the terrasse is already a unique experience, I travel all around the world and my stay in Gale Face was fantastic. Congrats.",4
3,"We stayed there for a few days before the dreadful attacks. What a shame, the impact will undoubtedly affect this place.,Very friendly staff; delightful place and utterly relaxing. Good breakfast as well and nice bars/restaurants.,Definitely recommended.",5
4,"This hotel is significant not only for its location but also its place in history. The museum will boast of Prince Philip's car and also a listing of renewed personalities around the world who have walked and stayed inside its walls. I visited to attend a meeting at the back wing where the museum is located. Their service was impeccable and the afternoon tea selection of sandwiches and cakes were delectable. The views from the beach were fantastic, they also have a flag retreat where bagpipes play at sundown. Best place to be when the sun sets.",4
5,Final night of a tour was the highlight. Could not have asked for better service including a late checkout and being looked after right up until the car picked us up. The flag ceremony at the going down of the sun was especially poignant and very British. Cocktails on the lawn were relaxing.,5
6,"The wooden architecture is really beautiful and the staff is really friendly. ,Good location and closer to the beach and other local shopping areas. ,These days since the terror attacks the security is a bit high but no complains because those things are really essential for security purpose.",4
7,"The best place to stay hands down in Colombo. ,From the moment we arrived the service and friendliness of this lovely historic hotel was amazing.,We were there with a very large conference some 300 people. Nothing was too much trouble.,Do yourself a favour and go to Sri Lanka and stay at Galle Face.,It is not to be missed.",4
8,Went to Galle Face hotel to grab a quick bite and some drinks with family. Look for Malinda @ king of mambo. Great service had a pleasant time dining on a fine day out facing the ocean at open terrace,4
9,"The rooms are exquisite with two cleankngcservices per day.The location is on the bay and by sleep with the sound of crashing waves in your ears. Staff and food are amazing. A must visit hotel for personal care . You are family, not a guest ",5
10,I am extremely disappointed with the management of the hotel. We meant to check in on Easter Sunday 21/4/19. As you all know Sri Lanka was shaken by a string of terrorist attacks that morning. We were advised not to move hotels and stay in put. The taxi service wasnât working in the hotel we were staying in as a result of the attacks as they said it was not safe to go out. We have called the hotel and asked if they could send us a taxi to transport us to the hotel (which obviously we would pay for) they told us they canât as their transportation service isnât running as well due to the terrorist attacks. I told them if thatâs the case there is no way that we can check in. However after 3 days they took the payment from my card. I have contacted Booking.com as I have booked through them and being on the phone for over 50mins the lady told me the hotel is refusing to refund the money as they marked us as âno showâ. I found it disgusting that they are still trying to make money out of the unfortunate situation. Itâs very sad.,1
11,"We stayed for two nights here and were blown away with the facilities, the beautiful old building, the food and drinks and also the staff. Arguably the best hotel I have ever stayed in. A special mention to Lalith at the Long Bar who was especially accomodating every evening - many thanks to him. ,We will be back. ,Thanks, ,Oscar ",5
12,"This is an amazing hotel and definitely worth staying at. The highlight is Happy Hour in the Long Room, where the best barman in Sri Lanka, LALITH, will serve you yummy canapÃ©s and re-fill your drink as the sun sets and the waves roll in. Thank you LALITH - we look forward to seeing you again next year.",4
13,"We love this place the staff are amazing it is very well priced for a fabulous grand hotel and I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a great Sea view,We have been here during this time of the ,Bombing but the security is incredible and ,The staff here have been very diligent and make us feel very safe",5
14,"The minute you step foot into The Galle Face Hotel you know you are in for a special time. I found this hotel to be exquisite in every respect. Our balcony room was spacious , well equipped and with lovely decor. Breakfast was located in an open verandah  overlooking gardens and ocean and offered a large range of SriLankan and Western foods. The lounge area offered wonderful afternoon canapÃ©s and drinks which was an added bonus with our room selection. The colonial history of this hotel has been maintained and is reflected in the decor and some of the hotels current services. All of this plus a great location made for the perfect beginning to a wonderful Sri Lankan holiday.",5
15,"Beautiful, colonial hotel by the ocean front. Lovely big, salt water pool overlooking the ocean (no ocean swimming allowed). Beach front local markets are a one minute walk from the hotel and a tuk tuk into central Colombo is not more than 5 or 10 minutes (depending where you are going; recommend using Uber as it can be used to book tuk tuks). Amazing breakfast selection. Wonderful staff. ",4
16,"We were staying elsewhere but visited for lunch. The prices were very reasonable and the food was very good. It was great for kids who are used to western food as there was a good range for them. The view and setting was lovely, making us wish we were staying there!",5
17,Two friends and I recently stayed at the Galle Face Hotel for three nights. The hotel and its grounds are lovely and historic. The pool is particularly nice and relaxing with views of the ocean. I would spend the money to get ocean view rooms above the basic room - they are far roomier and nicer bathrooms. The attacks in Colombo occurred during our stay in Sri Lanka but we felt very safe at the Galle Face and they were very helpful in helping us to navigate increased security at the hotel and the airport. ,3
18,"Great hotel. 150 years old and expect that some things are old! Great pool. Several bars and places to eat. Amazing balcony and poolside drinks and food. Piles of history and antiques and interest. Rooms were old but spacious and very comfortable and the service is exemplary. It is a great location too for most touristy sites and a walk in the evening along the sea. Thank you! I hope you are all safe and send huge sorry for the terrible things that happened this week.,Highly recommended.",4
19,"It was one of the most memorable hotel experiences of my life. Quite apart from the obvious beauty of the hotel architecture, the service was impeccable. Amazing staff - from the front desk to the door, the restaurants/pool/long bar, the chamber staff. I canât fault it and will definitely return. Special mention to Emmanuel, Chief Concierge, who went above and beyond.",5
20,"I first heard about this hotel on an episode of the Amateur Traveller podcast, and had always wanted to visit. And my stay there did not disappoint. Well run, with great service. The hotel and restaurants are very atmospheric given the heritage status from its colonial history. Had a nice view of the courtyard and ocean, with the sound of the ocean surf to put me to sleep. Enjoyed the sundown and flag lowering ceremony complete with bagpipes. Definitely recommended.",5
21,"This hotel is wonderfully located alongside the sea.  There is a lot going on in the evening with the bars taking advantage of this position.  Very helpful staff, especially in getting our bags back from Qatar Airways.  The food was a bit average, especially the breakfast with juice made from cordial.  Our room was okay bur nothing more than that.  We were greatly impressed with the free mini bar even if it was modestly stocked.  TV reception very poor.",3
22,"It's rare to be at a ""city"" hotel with a pool overlooking the ocean and a bar on the beach where you can enjoy the sunset, yet be able to walk to most attractions of interest.  And the next-door Galle Green is a popular public park where it is fun to stroll at sunset with local families.  Top that off with a 150 year old history, it's own museum, a brand-new renovation and beautiful spa, and you have one of my favourite hotels of a 4 week trip.  Service and breakfast were great and it has fun quirky touches (the slingshot guy who chases away crows, the guy who shimmies up the palm trees to trim them; the bagpiper at sunset).  Recommend the higher priced rooms with balcony and view which come with access to the Long Bar and free Happy Hour drinks and snacks.  Only downside arriving jet-lagged was that the bathroom space is not separate from the bed so if one partner is sleepless, the other will be disturbed.",5
23,Stayed one night in this hotel for our arrival into Sri Lanka for our honeymoon. Lovely hotel with all the old world charm of colonial era. Room was well maintained and had all the trimmings you'd expect of a hotel of this standard. Hotel has quite a bit of history and has many photos of previous hotel stayers like movie stars and bigname political leaders from around the world. They were very thoughtful and making us a welcoming honeymoon cake which was delicious and much appreciated. Staff and service were fantastic and the breakfast was pretty good. Highly recommend this place and would have no problem coming back here.,5
24,My husband and I had a wonderful time at The Pool Bar at Galle Face. Amazing staff for their excellent service. We visited Sri Lanka for our Sweet holiday vacation. Since Galle Face Hotel is one of the Iconic Landmark we decided to take a look and gladly our time was not wasted. We had a wonderful day at The Pool Bar. Surely once we visit again Sri Lanka were going to stay at this Hotel and be back again at The Pool Bar. Thanks to Mr. Indika and his colleague for making our vacation memorable and wonderful. Keep up a good work!!!,4
25,"We stayed here for one night. On the plus side.... breakfast was very good, dinner at in-house Mexican was lovely. In general the communal areas were very nice and what you would expect from a hotel like this. ,I was initially not happy with the cost of the hotel car to airport but when arrived it was a large Merc and very very comfortable. Worth additional money. ,The sticking point for us was the rooms that we were allocated, which were in the non-renovated part of the hotel. Avoid if possible. We had an adjoining room requirement and it was one night so no dramas... but they need to sort these out. Mildly depressing and unlike the previous places we stayed in Sri Lanka, we were not too keen on hanging around in the room much. This notches rating from 5 to 4 for us. ",3
26,"A fantastic hotel, full of old world colonial charm. In a great location on the beach & beside the green, close to the city centre but without the traffic.,I loved the way the old floor boards had been retained, some loose, some wobbly.,Room was excellent with a comfy bed and spotless bathroom.,The staff are what makes this hotel special, nothing is a problem and you will always be welcomed with a smile.,The breakfast buffet is everything you can desire and served outside in a covered terrace.,Why would you want to stay anywhere else in Colombo",4
27,"Very special place to stay. Service is done with a smile by all staff and the food is amazing. Beautiful setting right on the water and easy walk close by to the old parliament. The decor and complete layout of the whole complex is a an old style opulent hotel. Also the collection of photographs of who has stayed there over the years is a who's who of stars, presidents, royals etc and the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Phillips first motorcar display is a great touch on the second floor.",4
28,Everything here is first class. The staff are very attentive and helpful from advice to breakfast to the pool area. Loved the guy sling shotting the crows. He never hit one but did a great job very entertaining. The room Was quiet except for the ocean waves which was very calming. The restaurants and bars are all around the hotel from fine dining to afternoon snacks. No need to leave the hotel really. The pool area is literally on the beach and spectacular but a bit salty and warm. Great surrounds there for relaxing the entire day on the lounges.  Very recommended. ,5
29,"The location of this Hotel is unimaginable, the boundary wall of which is infinite Indian Ocean. It is on the immediate edge of the ocean. Wonderful view. Restaurant is also just before the edge of the ocean, providing excellent experience. Food and service is also par excellence. Rooms are spacious. It has everything that is needed by any traveler. Only one suggestion. Before using the bathrooms and locking the same, learn from staff how to lock and unlock. Turn the lock only once till you hear click. For opening the lock of the bathroom turn the lock in reverse direction only once till you hear the click. More turns and you may get stuck.@Management: please change the bathroom locks.",5
30,"A nice place to experience old world charm. The hotel is old but does not show signs of ageing at all. In fact, the hotel is so old that it has a museum inside the hotel and they have a guided tour of the hotel itself on particular dates/times.,Be sure to read about the hotel before you land there as it will help you explore the hotel. They have a great library and interesting artefacts throughout the hotel.,The swimming pool was a new experience for me with salt water but I did not enjoy it too much.,They have a decent spread for breakfast and a great service though I would recommend this for a lazy quiet trip with your partner rather than with the family.,All in all, it is a nice experience and something that you should do.",4
31,"Great hotel, service and location. Happily stay there again. Good food reasonably priced with lots of options. Front of house well run and a range of options with sea views for pre dinner drink,Good sized and clean bedroom  ",5
32,"The halls move and creak ever so slightly in this lovely, massive old dear of a hotel.  Renovated beautifully, this place will transport you back a century to a different world, while keeping its hospitality clearly in today.  Like her sister the Del Coronado across the world, Galle Face is, miraculously, dressed and ready for the ball.  You'll find great food and even a designated man with a slingshot to keep away the wise murder of crows that owns the veranda.  We wish we had a bit more time than a day here, as it seems there is much to discover.",4
33,"We stayed here late in January 2019. We love the grand old hotels and this one was excellent. We had a Landmark Qeen Room which was very large and comfortable with a view of the pool and ocean.  The breakfast, which was included, was very good with great variety available.  We left after breakfast.  The front desk arranged for our car and driver to take us to Marissa which worked well.",5
34,"The Galle Face is spectacular.  You feel like you have stepped back to another century, and can image the British from the days of the Raj strolling through the hotel. We stayed 3 nights and were sorry we couldn't stay longer.  Our junior suite was lovely, out balcony gorgeous (more lovely than the balcony in The Long Room [the Club Room]).  Buffet breakfast on the terrace facing the ocean was lovely, the food delicious.  Spectacular.",5
35,Beautiful hotel with a sea water swimming pool.  Very attentive staff in the bar areas but a lot of the time the door staff were more ornament than use.  We were upgraded to a sea view for which we were grateful.  Did not eat dinner here but breakfast was delicous.,4
36,"Galle Face hotel takes you back to a time when service was paramount.,This has not changed and all the staff especially our room staff were very happy to help at all times,Food was superb but as always a little on the expensive side which we have come to expect when we travel.,Would recommend to any travellers looking for a stay in Colombo but it is not really suitable for young kids as does not have much to offer them.,Salt water pool was good but deep all over and if you are under 5ft 6inch you won't touch the floor",4
37,"Service can improve, lacks professionalism compared to hotels of this calibre in Asia and also Europe. Food is good, especially the restaurant by the beach which is of South American influence. Taxi service too expensive compared to other hotels.",4
38,"I stayed on a recent business trip to Sri Lanka. The staff are welcoming, friendly and very helpful. Although an hour or more from the airport depending on traffic, it is worth the effort. If you like the sound of the ocean, make sure you get a room with a sea view. The grounds are simply beautiful and try and make it there for sunset as the Sri Lankan flag is lowered to bagpipe music. Enough to say that I will be back and for more than two night next time. ",4
39,"May this will be the best ever hotel to stay with your loved one - overlooking the Indian Ocean.,The rooms on the top floor with windows towards ocean is the best. The staff are very well trained and donât miss the museum",5
40,"My husband and I  booked the Galle Face Hotel on Booking.com for my first night in Sri Lanka on 17 March 2019.  We arrived with proof of booking and payment of Â£133 GBP.  I had just arrived after an over night flight from the UK.  Unfortunately, despite this, the hotel could find no record of this and after spending more than 2 hours at reception, did not provide us with the room we booked.  Exhausted, we were left with no option but to leave with nowhere to stay having just arrived in the country.  Losing the money was nothing compared to being treated in this disgraceful way by a hotel of this calibre.  This coupled with the fact that when we used to live in Sri Lanka  we used to go to the hotel regularly and were in fact join members of the swimming pool between 2013 and 2014.  Nobody followed this up with us during our 3 week break in Sri Lanka.",1
41,"The hotel is in good condition,so much to see just walking around it. Some rooms are older style which might not suit everyone.I loved the breakfast area and the food quality was great .Need more shade/umbrellas for the pool.Lovely pool area overlooking the ocean",5
42,"We visited for afternoon tea as part of our tour, beautiful colonial style hotel, excellent afternoon tea with fizz. We thoroughly reccomend it as part of your visit to Colombo, very retro and reminiscent of times past.",4
43,"You can stay in a marble palace if you prefer - thereâs plenty to choose from nearby in Colombo. Problem is, if you let your mind wander, you could easily forget which city youâre in. Galle Face Hotel is different. Stay here and youâre in somewhere unique to Colombo. Not just a fine building oozing history and colonial charm but a very comfortable and superbly managed hotel made special by one magic ingredient that money alone cannot buy. The staff. Itâs they who make the place what it is. Every one of them made out visit special but mention must be made of the fantastic reception team, buffet and pool bar staff (thanks to Ashley for his advice and help in planning our trip to Kandy), the laundry service (5*+), and lastly the catapult men for keeping the crows in check. Ignore any negative comments. This place is too good for words.",4
44,"We stayed at The Galle Face hotel as a treat on the first 2 nights of our honeymoon in Sri Lanka.,The building is really beautiful and oozes old school colonial charm.,We particularly enjoyed sitting outside having cocktails on the chequerboard terrace and watching the sunset. ,The breakfast buffet was beyond amazing with an array of fruit, pastries, curries, pancake station, omelette station, eggs, sausages, hoppers...it was the highlight of our stay!,We also had an evening meal (Sri Lankan Street food buffet - there's a different themed buffet every night) in the Verandah restaurant which was delicious and again offered a vast amount of choice.,We enjoyed the pool which is very large with an ocean view.,The hotel is extremely well staffed so there's always someone on hand if you need them and all the staff we spoke to were friendly and helpful.,The room was very comfortable but actually quite simply furnished compared to the grandeur of the rest of the hotel.,Small tip - hotel taxis can be expensive, consider using Uber or a metered tuk tuk.",4
45,We stayed for a couple of nights here and loved it. It has so much charm and character compared to the newer hotel chains. The building is beautiful and the location is surely the best in colombo.  The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was amazing with so much choice.  Would love to go back someday.,5
46,The hotel is amazing with lots of history. Very clean rooms and great staff. The breakfast buffet was amazing and so is the pool. The gym is decent could use some more equipment but overall an awesome old colonial hotel!,5
47,By the Indian ocean this is a gem of old English charm & tradition. The bar is great decorated with the photos of the famous who have travelled there before. The rooms could do with an update but it is still a great place to stay and a nice respite from the bustling city of Colombo. ,4
48,"We went as a family of four to the Galle Face Hotel in May. We had loads of fun. The pool was warm and sunny, and the buffet was extremely outstanding. But unfortunately, the wonderful view of the big blue Andaman sea is getting smaller as a huge complex is being built on a man-made peninsula. So, go there soon, before it is finished and the view is gone. A wonderful hotel with an enchanting vibe from the 1950s and cute, little rooms. We hope to come back one day. An amazing experience.",5
49,A nice few days to relax and treat ourselves between travelling to the more remote parts of Sri Lanka. A beautiful traditional Sri Lankan colonial hotel with lots of history. Good service as you would expect and the buffet dinner was plentiful and tasty .,5
50,"Classy service in well maintained facilities. Very different from four or five star chain hotels. History is present at any moment.,Rooms differ from each other  - not surprising bearing in mind the number of renovations this hotel must have gone through.",5
51,"Having spent some 12 hours flying from Australia we didn't arrive at this hotel until about 1am. Staff greeted us with a warm towel and refreshing drink that was appreciated after a long days travel. ,The hotel is located on the foreshore of the Indian Ocean near the older former British established section of Colombo. The rooms were a good size, well appointed though like many hotels in Sri Lanka they have firm mattresses. ,Breakfast on the ground floor enabled us to not only enjoy a beautiful buffet food selection that included a hopper and egg station, also a lovely view across lawns to the ocean. Walking around both inside and outside enabled you to appreciate the grandeur of this British origins hotel.,A hotel very worthy of a longer stay.",4
52,"Great hotel very friendly saff, breakfast excellent. Stayed only one night after long flight but very welcoming hotel and staff,Little more old worldly than some of the high rise hotels that are being built now,Right on The foreshore",5
53,This hotel has it's own legend and a history. but it has all modern items to compete with all other hotels around the globe. my tour company highly recommended the hotel. They were right. I won't forget two things. breakfast with the breeze next to the beach and chilling out with cold beers watching sunset. really comfy rooms and food.,4
54,"Absolutely fantastic spot to sit and watch the sundown with a chilled out drink.,Be sure to be there just before sundown to catch the bagpipe procession to lower the Flag,If you want to eat, be sure to make a reservation several days ahead; the tables are ALWAYS reserved during high seasons,Great colonial vibe and very chilled.,Staff is friendly and quick but not overbearing,Enjoy!",4
55,"We had 2+ weeks in Sri Lanka staying in both large and very small hotels.  We heard that the Sri Lankan government has introduced environmental policies encouraging refillable supplies, stainless steel straws &/or paper straws etc?  Galle Face are now using paper straws but not refillable containers in bathrooms yet.  Considering that they were one of the most expensive hotels on our holiday, we feel that they need to address this like other hotels have done.  In saying that, our country, Australia, could do a whole lot better as well but we didnât vote them in!  Other than that, an interesting and relaxing stay...the weather was hot (not too wet yet in mid March) and the pool plus bar was particularly lovely.  Breakfast was very good...loved the freshly made hoppers (see photo).  The history of the place is great - take a read of various information panels plus have a look in their little âmuseumâ if youâre a history nerd like me!",5
56,"Stayed two nights and would have been very happy to have spent longer at this very good hotel. We loved the old colonial style, the location right on the ocean front, the attractive pool area and the excellent breakfast. Ok the view from our âsea viewâ room was mostly towards the main road but the room was lovely. We could have done with a bit more information in our room about the facilities such as restaurants (with menus would be helpful) as the building is big and we only came across the upstairs bar and restaurant when we took a wrong turning on the second floor - they both seemed deserted so maybe we werenât the only ones to be unaware of them. There were complimentary canapÃ©s and a happy hour somewhere we were told at check-in but we didnât come accross this and again there was no information in the room. We could have asked of course but 5.30 was rather early in the evening for us. Dinner time here is early-ish too with many sitting down in the main dining room at 7.00 - we ate later in the bar with live music and the food was ok. Overall we would recommend the hotel and stay there again - next time we might make a bit more effort to work out where al the facilities are located.",4
57,A really top notch place to come hang out for brilliant guys serving you high grade booze and food.  Pure atmosphere.  A very classy experience  A super special spot that mustn't be missed if you visit Colombo.,4
58,"Stayed  2 nights in November 2018. First room offered had someone else's balcony outside our window so we're moved to a corner room. Lovely wooden floors and old furniture, large room and lots of shared areas in hotel. Could hear upstairs neighbours as floors all wood. Pool and gardens lovely. Some lounges seemed to be only for club guests but weren't labelled as such, so just sat there anyway and staff seekers bit uncomfortable but did nothing!",4
59,"Great Colonial historical hotel, (so dont expect shinny glittery halls & rooms) we had an ocean view room with a terrace so didn't use the pool/bar area...we stayed 2 nights after our arrival in Colombo & after a day touring the city...perfect ...we really didn't fancy any of the big flash named hotels as they are all the same world wide as we wanted a taste of old sri lanka...2 nights is enough.,very friendly staff & excellent service...,Great buffet bâfast & evening buffet, we ate out in the city on the other night.",5
60,"This colonial style hotel was recently renovated, but has kept every bit of its colonial Charme. Itâs beautifully decorated and equipped and the staff is really nice. Itâs a beautiful place to arrive in the country and relax. We already came back once and will come back again!",5
61,"Great location lots of history but those place is expensive! I loved the cocktail hour on the second floor. The was only for those staying in a suite so a lot fewer people to contend with, local munchies and decent red wine made it worth the money. But how many times are you in Galle? may as well enjoy a great hotel.",5
62,"This hotel is not cheap but it's worth every cent to stay here.  The hotel itself is a little tired but oozes character.  There is a great swimming pool area, the service is brilliant, and the location we loved.  We stayed in a junior suite (2020 which seemed bigger than the others) which gives you access to the club all day for coffee/tea and then aperitf at 5.30.  This is not to be missed.  The breakfast was included and was excellent.",5
63,Alas couldnât afford to stay.  But went numerous times whilst in Colombo.  For coffee on the breathtaking verandah.  For the amazing buffet breakfast. And for their Vivien Leigh cocktail.  Service is superb. Staff too.  The bar has photographs of who has stayed there. A British Literary whoâs who.  And also the divine Viv.  Itâs charm and beauty are addictive. The skill and friendliness of the staff second to none.  A trip back in time indeed. A wonderful gentle experience. ,4
64,"Good first impresions always count for a happy stay at any hotel,and Nadeesha at reception at the Galle Face Hotel was extremely helpful in helping us with complex flight arrangements back to London via Chennai as well as assisting with a late check out on the 11th.Both her and her colleague were supportive with that wonderful kind Singalese manner.",4
65,"We arrived at the the Galle Face after a 12 hour flight from LHR and were greeted by charming staff and a lovely cool towel and lime drink.,The rooms was perfect, we went down to the lawn area for a beer just in time to watch the flag lowering at sunset accompanied by a bagpiper.,We had a dinner in the hotel and enjoyed a wonderful curry and rice with lots of choice .,Breakfast was also excellent , we then departed for our trip round Sri Lanka and returned for our last night .Very nice oceanfront room another excellent breakfast.,O very good venue to start and finish our holiday .",4
66,This was a great spa experience ! The L'occitane spa was absolutely amazing - we got a couples spa done. The spa was relaxing and the therapists were very nice. The hotel has a beautiful view and had a very nice grand old feel.,5
67,This hotel was one of the memorable parts of our trips. Stunning sea view and amazing food in stylish surroundings. We absolutely loved our stay and would highly recommend. The hotel was so elegant and friendly staff. We got upgraded on check in which was so nice.,5
68,I stayed at the Galle Face for the Ironman 70.3 Sri Lanka. It was superb. The room was beautiful restored but with all the modern appliances  and bathroom. I fell asleep to the sound of the sea. Amazing. They were very polite and put up with me reeling through the hotel with my bike and covered in sweat. Loved the place especially the salt water swimming pool,5
69,We spent 1 night at this lovely hotel. The colonial style was very appealing and the room was comfortable .We ate at the restaurant and had a few drinks at the travellers bar . Location was good too with the beach close by and getting out and about to the different areas . Will definitely stay here again on our next trip.,5
70,"We had an upgraded room with balcony and sea view. lovely big bathroom, all very clean.,Very nice but huge hotel, all very colonial and lovely.,Good restaurant, also a poolside restaurant and a cocktail bar.,Only stayed one night but very good. Good room service.",4
71,"This was the first hotel on our tour of Sri Lanka and it created a good first impression.,There is history here in this elegant building. Great atmosphere in an excellent setting by the sea.,Breakfast was served on the terrace overlooking the water. After breakfast we walked down to the water's edge to admire the view.,One surprise was to find a uniformed security guard with a slingshot who was keeping the crows and squirrels away from the patrons. I've never seen this before and probably never will see it again.,It's a pity that the lighting in the rooms wasn't better. Then again a lot of hotels all over the world seem to do this. Maybe it's mood lighting but I like to be able to see what I'm doing.",5
72,"This hotel oozes history and the location canât be beat. I would recommend booking directly to avoid booking issues. The Premium Rooms with balcony are worth the extra money! Thanks to Keeth, our housekeeper, for an exceptional job!",4
73,"Old world charmer, built in 1864. Reeks of luxury, the minute you walk onto the huge marble floored foyer. Our room was comfortable, with a partial view of the enormous courtyard.  The lighting in the room we had was very poor. Bed comfort was good.  ,The buffet dinner had a large selection of various foods, something for everyone and looked out to the courtyard, where you could hear the sounds of the ocean. Unfortunately our time to enjoy the facilities was limited and if ever we return to Columbo we would certainly come back here",4
74,"Grand, historic hotel completely refurbished. Reception team excellent. We booked direct and had a Premier Ocean View Balcony Room 3079 (excellent); and we enjoyed the Terrace and Travellers' Restaurants for lunch and dinner over 3 nights. All staff most courteous (including Keeth, our room manager). Swimming pool, sun loungers, pool bar and Galle Green for promenading. A very enjoyable stay!",5
75,"We always stay at Galle Face Hotel Colombo. Love the old colonial charm. You can feel the history of yesteryears in every corner of the grand old building. ,Excellent meals, no matter what time it is. And, great coffee too, one of the few places we managed to get a real coffee.  ,Take a stroll along the Galle Face Promenade, just the way the Brits been doing for the past 200-300 years. And, enjoy the stunning sunsets.",5
76,"Stayed two nights at the start of our Sri Lanka trip. We were met by our driver Neil who would drive us throughout our holiday( this is the norm here and very affordable). We arrived in the early hours ,exhausted and wanting immediate sleep. We were given an early check in but had to pay extra. ,The hotel I believe is one of the oldest in the world. It has a charm that only history can deliver. However the rooms are dark ,and very basic but not at a basic price. ,The pool is a big let down. A rectangular box surrounded by beds, no natural shade and insufficient parasols. Many of the parasols are broken. The toilets dingy and âfeel â unclean. The whole area looks very sad and tired. ,Would I stay again,not unless it has a complete refurb. I would highly recommend cocktails / coffee on the veranda. ",2
77,"We stayed in the Royal Thai Suite during our stay and it was brilliant. ,The lounge area is spacious with a water room.,The bedroom itself is also ample with french doors to the balcony.,The restaurant offers a quality buffet.,The salt water pool is pleasant.",4
78,"We had the most wonderful stay at this hotel, unfortunately it was for one night only but we thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Upon check in we were delighted we had been upgraded. Our room was beautiful - large, airy and had a separate lounge area. We had not one but two plasma screens! Breakfast included a large array of buffet items so to keep everyone satisfied. The breakfast view were dreamy! The only negative we experienced is that there was a very noisy wedding reception which was causing our walls to vibrate, thankfully the music stopped by 11/11:30 pm!",5
79,"Grand old hotel with all the old world charm of colonial yesteryear.  Get a feel of what it was like back in the 1800's. The timber features and furniture and decor are glorious and our room facilities were all very modern and we felt spoilt.  The front staff excellent.  The cleaning staff were wonderful. The wait staff were generally all very smiling and helpful.  It was quite amusing to watch the bird scarer at breakfast.  He had a slingshot to hold up to scare the crows off the furniture.  Someone was being employed I guess and it kept the outdoor furniture clean.,The hotel faces the ocean but swimming is discouraged, but there is a pool for those inclined.,Our only negative which was remedied immediately the next morning was that the room we had the first night faced the main street, and it was very noisy at 5 am from traffic. We arrived 2.30 that morning so a sleep in would have been nice. But she changed our room immediately. So that aside we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,Breakfast was exceptional - it seemed a little over the top to me, but you could literally eat the world if you wanted.  But that said, I thoroughly enjoyed my fresh cooked omelettes, the local curries and accompaniments, and the fresh local fruits for breakfast.  ",4
80,"If you like old grand hotels, this is one of them. The pool is salt water and large enough. Very pretty common areas and large reception rooms where weddings and banquets are held. As an overnight guest, however, the rooms were small and older (updated with limitations) and the sound comes through as ours had a connecting door (one door only) and our neighbor was conducting business loudly on the phone right next to the door.  They had an early morning wake up call and we can hear the alarm. We were told we were upgraded to a room with a sea view but that did not make up for the noise factor. The bed was a double and we are used to a king size. Pool sleep quality.,The breakfast and dinner were buffet style and was fine. birds can snatch your food but they have someone with a slingshot guarding.,Did have a massage at the spa. The therapist was nice and good. The facility is also an attempt at a spa using existing space so it was all a bit odd. The whirlpool was cold and nowhere to sit in the changing room.  We would not return.",3
81,"The GFH is one of the oldest hotels in Colombo, and catered to the Colonial types ( ""'no natives please""), who patronized it in days gone by .Unfortunately it still retains the decrepit waiters who have long past their ""used by "" dates. I and a friend visited the GFH (albeit more than a year ago - but the memory lingers) - where we waited 30 minutes before anyone would condescend to take our order.",1
82,"My husband and I stayed at the GFH for one night; our first night in Sri Lanka before heading to Tangalle. We arrived just at the right time to watch the sunset from our bedroom, stunning. Although the bed was only a double (used to a bigger bed) the bed sheets were amazing! ,One stand out person for us was the concierge, Emmanuelle. Even though he was due to go off duty, he helped us to secure the train tickets we needed for our 7am journey the following morning. Above and beyond, thank you so much. ,We definitely wished we could have stayed longer than one night and would definitely come back. ",5
83,We were on holiday in Colombo but just visited the bar for a couple of cocktails. Pricey compared to other establishments but lovely cocktails and nothing compared to London prices ! Beautiful views . Afternoon tea looked good too ! I had a Colombo spice gin. Friendly staff . ,4
84,"Excellent all round. Given its history it could have been stuffy and formal, but it managed to avoid this, and was very relaxed and informal. Service was generally good and only let down by slow service in the bars. The food was excellent in the buffet, and we also enjoyed the King of the Mambo restaurant. Rooms are very nice, and the sea water pool a bonus. Prices for drinks and food were very reasonable considering the surroundings",5
85,"We stayed for two nights at the Galle Face Hotel and would happily have stayed longer.,OK it's vast, and the floors creak, but it's splendid. We had a Landmark Queen Room which was nicely furnished and clean with a comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom. The only thing missing was a balcony, although we did enjoy a sea view.,Everything about the hotel oozes class, from the flower arrangements in reception to murals and artwork, and furniture dotted around the common areas - it's all exceptional.,We found the quality and choice of food for either breakfast or buffet dinner excellent, and although we were only booked in on a B&B basis we ate dinner here twice as we thought the price was most reasonable.,The staff we found to be helpful friendly and very obliging too, that's everyone from the front desk personnel in changing money for small denominations for us, to the lovely gentleman security guard firing at rooks with his catapult.,The pool is great too. OK it's salt water, but is a big pool and quite deep too and seems clean and well looked after. Maybe the gents shower area here could do with a bit of an update though.,The grounds here are just a magnificent place to watch the sun go down too.,Complaints? - can't think of any, so we'd be delighted to have the chance to stay here again....superb!",5
86,"This magnificent, restored, Colonial Hotel, is a great place to stay while in this lovely country, you feel pampered as soon as you walk in the doors. Breakfast is epic, rooms are stunning, tastefully decorated, very comfortable beds, and stunning rugs on old polished floors, staff are superb",5
87,"This is a magnificent old building in a fabulous location. while you can see a few signs of wear & tear due to its age, the hotel is clean and well appointed. The breakfast buffet was extensive, well presented and of a very high standard. Probably the best feature of the hotel are the people who work there, absolutely wonderful!! they were extremely helpful and welcoming. nothing was too much trouble. for example we received a message from one of the other hotels on our itinerary was having difficulty with our booking, The concierge (Emmanuelle) made several calls on our behalf and sorted the problem out for us. This was something I didn't expect but it was very much appreciated. Overall we were disappointed to leave the hotel and wished we had been able to stay a few more days. Well done Galle Face Hotel!!!",4
88,"I love breakfast, I'm a breakfast buff, it's the best part of the day. The mind is fresh and hungry... At the Galle Face Hotel you can eat with all senses. This place is full of history and so well maintained for over 100 years, it's unbelievable. Harrison Ford dined and stayed amongst all the other film stars, presidents and musicians. The breakfast speed is divine with a choice of juices from heaven and even king coconut water filled and chilled in jugs. Pancakes, hoppers, idly, waffles, porridge, fruit (including rose apple when in season) and gluten free raspberry muffins. Please can I have breakfast forever!!!!",4
89,This hotel is the most fantastic. You can feel the history at the high tea was perfect. I am a vegetarian and they could make a nice high tea for me. The pool and pool bar direct to the see was fantastic. I love this place!!!,5
90,"The hotel was like stepping back to the colonial era. They say it was the best hotel east of the Suez n i tend to agree,We had rm2054 a twin share.it had a huge balcony with good views across the harbour n city.The bathroom was modern with a separate wc. The room had ac and a ceiling fan The buffet dinner and breakfast were great and there was a free happy hour 5.30- 7.00 The pool was huge although very salty n they had a reasonable gym, steam room, sauna ,spa as well as extensive massage therapy rooms.I could easily live there and cant wait to go back!",5
91,"I didnât stayed at this hotel but I had to write a review about their helpful staff.,Since my arrival all the staff was extremely helpful and courteous.,I needed to contact someone by phone and Mrs Yvone from the reception desk was spectacular!! She not only called my tour company but made sure my driver was outside before I got there.,Many hotels would not considering help someone that is not a guest but this one it was an exception.,I definitely would stay here when I come back to Colombo.",4
92,"This is a first rate Hotel. Totally and well modernised Colonial Building with extremely high standards of service, food, management and accommodation. This is an historic building and is beautifully maintained.,This is a must if you are staying in Colombo and are prepared to spend a totally fair but highish rate for accommodation.,The food is first rate and there is a great deal of choice from Buffet to a la carte and eating round the pool or in the ""with it"" bar above the beach.,It is extremely well managed and all the staff are first rate. Nothing is too much trouble which is as it should be.,If I have one niggle it would be that the Check In was laboriously slow and tedious which is a bore at 2pm in the afternoon after a long journey with children when one had booked 3 weeks in advance.,This is as good as any 5 star Hotel I have stayed in in London and I would definitely include it if I was to travel to Sri Lanka again. I recommend it.",5
93,"This legendary hotel has it all: History, location, impressing decor, great food, a 30 m swimming pool and a beautiful sea view. But it also has slow and absent service at breakfast - had to ask for coffee three times to mention one example - and loud music throughout all of the hotel until 11.30pm. And no beach at all, if youâre imagining that.",4
94,"This is an iconic and very nice hotel, the breakfast and breakfast area is really lovely.,We were there for 1 night after landing from France early afternoon. We were put in a room on the 3rd floor and heard a lot of loud music mid afternoon, I phoned reception and they told me it would stop soon (it didn't) when we came back about 10pm and ready to go to bed the noise was really loud...after complaining we were moved to the 2nd floor to a really great room with a huge terrace overlooking Galle face which was nice. Point is that they knew there was a big and noisy reception going on above the 3rd floor but still put people there! Nice that they moved us quickly and to such a nice room, but....",4
95,"Following a long and tiring flight via Dubai after our initial flight was cancelled, we were so glad to get to this iconic hotel - albeit in the rain. We had specifically asked for a sea view room, and to be fair, we could see the sea from the side window. It wasnât until we came to get to sleep that we found that the room was on the front corner overlooking a busy and noisy roundabout !,Although the management offered to change the room for  us for the second night, it didnât seem worth the inconvenience just for one night.,It was just a shame that we werenât put into a proper sea view room which overlooked the beach.,The buffet dining in the Veranda restaurant was very good, and we were able to enjoy the pool on the final afternoon.,The staff were all very obliging and helpful.,It was fascinating to go round their âmuseumâ ( hall of fame), and imagine just how grand it would have been in its heyday.,It is a large hotel with considerable charm - just get a room away from the main road.",4
96,"This classic hotel's architecture reminds me of the famous Raffles in Singapore albeit much smaller. We only went there one evening for drinks and dinner so I haven't visited the rooms. But the antique furniture in the lobby, and the sunset over the ocean certainly look worth it.",4
97,"We went to have a walk in the afternoon to see the sunset and had a lovely chat with the locals. Sunday is bit crowded with locals so be there on weekdays to have a good walk and relax.,We will be back to here when we comes to colombo again.",4
98,"This is a great place to stay in Colombo, itâs on the ocean but within easy reach of the city centre by tuktuk, and itâs good for a stroll around Galle Green.,We had a room with ocean view - well worth booking this. ,Service was very good, pool a decent size but difficult to find shade at some times during the day so we retired to the adjacent pool bar for beers and snacks!,The main Veranda Restaurant is good, and has a great view, but was really busy and a bit chaotic when we were there for dinner; they focus on their buffet but will do a la carte if you are sufficiently insistent!,If we return to Colombo we will return to the Galle Face.",4
99,What an experience ! What a setting! A brilliant experience overall watching the sun go down and a flag ceremony to accompany the whole thing. Brilliant planned by the hotel team. Try the tea buffet.they leave a large three tier stand on your table full of good bite sized food.,5
100,"Built in the 1800s itâs a grand building in a  central location by the sea but this hotel is 20 years overdue for renovation.,Disgusting smell of sewerage in one wing. Service well below average. Breakfast offering very limited and poor. Expensive, especially when you add service charges and taxes. Not value.",3
101,"We have just left Galle Face Hotel after staying for 2 nights.,Upon arriving we were amazed at the lobby and it just got better and better!,When walking around the Hotel it really feels like you have gone back to Colonial times, the atmosphere is fantastic.,The rooms are not massive but are fine for a couple looking at using other facilities in the hotel and or exploring Colombo like we did.,The Hotel Bar and Reataurants could not get any closer to the Sea and the views across the ocean are incredible, we managed to make it back for Sunset on our second day and it really is breathtaking.,I had a Tuna Salad for Lunch which was cooked to perfection and they have a good selection of drinks including some loverly cocktails that my wife very much enjoyed!,Beware though that this Hotel does not include Service Charge or Government Taxes in its price so and on about 1/3 to all prices listed.,Iâd love to go back to this hotel and if we get the opportunity Iâm sure we will!",5
102,"GFH is centrally located and has always served me well for small strategy sessions with core team members. The staff are super efficient and always willing to help!,This of course is in probably the most classy and well preserved âTimeless Grandeurâ of a hotel which has been around since 1864!",5
103,"We only spent one night here. The suite was very large and had everything you needed. ,The property is kept in a colonial style with old furniture and dark wood. The outside area is very nice. Breakfast is facing the sea and there was a huge choice which was impressive.",4
104,"Nice reception staff, and helpful concierge.  Bedroom rather tired looking.  Great verandah bar looking out the ocean.  Needs more sun umbrellas around the pool.  Could do with another 6 - 8.  And groan.....when will big hotels stop using plastic straws?  Must use hundreds and hundreds in a single day.  Use paper or just don't.    The usual request to 'save the planet' by not needing towels washed every day is a bit hackneyed and old hat.  I wanted to see a strong sustainability statement from this hotel which has been in Sri Lanka for many years.",3
105,"I was staying in the premier suite and it was quite a larger room with decent size (double) twin beds. It was basically a an appointment type.  I liked the bathroom especially,quite big and bright and very useful for ladies. Also I liked the way they separate the toilet.,My room was immaculate with ocean views. The hotel was originally built by four British entrepreneurs in 1864, you need at least a half day to explore the hotel remarkable history displayed in the library. ,I was impressed by all of staff with their professionalism and they are very helpful and extremely friendly. ,Morning buffet is amazing with the variety and quality, great way to start the morning. I will be certaily staying here again definitely.",4
106,"Beautiful Hotel, excellent staff, fantastic breakfast... truly a World Heritage Hotel! we were given a smelly room at check-in but they changed it for us the next morning. The sunset views and the ceremony of lowering the flag at sunset was amazing.  The hotel needs to be on the Colombo sight seeing trip!",4
107,The magnificent building is on the shore. The whole place has a lovely colonial feel to it. The staff are immaculate and the service is good. There are options as to restaurants and a wine cellar for a pre dinner drink. The room we stayed in was spacious with a very comfy bed.,5
108,"Fab time at the Galle Face Hotel - a real touch of luxury. Would recommend it as a place to stay either just after flying into Colombo airport or the night(s) preceding your departure (this is more due to Colombo being quite small rather than the hotel quality). ,Hotel is nicely decorated and the small museum is a great touch. Breakfast is excellent and the views from the restaurant and pool are awesome. ,Drinks and food are quite pricey for Sri Lanka and speed of service can be quite relaxed - but the quality is good and it adds to the relaxed environment. ,Reception team are very accommodating, warm and friendly, and were helpful with some driver issues we had after checkout.",4
109,Very nice hotel in the beach of Colombo. Nearly perfect service very friendly good educated stuff. The dinner and breakfast was very delicious and fresh. A good place to stay some days in Colombo. Good prices for lunch and drinks at the bar.,4
110,This was our second time at the Galle Face and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff is professional and helpful. We particularly liked having lunch at the Traveler's Bar and drinks at the pool bar with beautiful views of an ocean storm and sunset. The hotel is steeped in history and feels simply grand. My critiques of the hotel are that none of the restaurants offer Sri Lankan cuisine (with the exception of the usual rice and curry) and the traffic noise from the main road. We decided to eat dinner elsewhere so that we could have more Sri Lankan choices. The western food served at the hotel and breakfast dishes were quite good though.,5
111,"Colomboâs probably finest hotel many years ago. Still trying to keep up, but not always with success. ,Despite high price (an. 2.000 $ 3 nights) booked suite with see view. On arrival weâre upgraded to presidential suite, which was very ok. Staying there gave us also access to lounge with free drinks, snacks and canapÃ©s. Once overlooking see and sunset. ,Negative part was breakfast. To crowded, below average food. Free breakfast, but still had to pay for bottled water?",5
112,"We visited for a quick dinner and the atmosphere and the location of the place was amazing! . Seated in open air, the sea breeze felt good and the Colombo waters added to the vibe. Speaking of food, we ordered a basic Caesar Salad, Beef Burger, Nasi Goreng and a portion of Fish and Chips. Flavourful it was but portion wise it was small. Tad bit on the pricey end too. The best you can get here is the view. Must return for a beautiful sunset experience.",4
113,"One of those old world hotels, where the Royalty and Important guest have stayed over the past 150 years or so, renovated over the years, wooden staircases etc, lot's of facilities including restaurants overlooking the Indian Ocean, late night music on the ocean front etc",5
114,"Wasnât the best of starts as our room was not to our taste nor seemingly the room we had thought we had booked. However, after speaking to reception we were moved to a room that was much suitable. We have had a very enjoyable time since. I recommend the tour of the hotel with the resident historian as it was very insightful. At sunset the flag is lowered to the sound of the bagpipes, which to my husband conjured images of what life may have been like in colonial times. He also particularly enjoyed his Roger Moore Martini. There are many newer modern chain hotels popping up but I donât think they could beat this! ",4
115,"Great seafront location retaining all the old colonial features. ,Service and food excellent. ,Rooms were meant to be superior but we had a view of the car park and railway line. Hate to see an ordinary standard room!! ,Beware the hotel taxi at least three to four times the cost of local taxi and billed to your room. We did not know so taxi driver , who stood waiting payment before getting our bags out , got  a eking tip at out expense. ",3
116,"We checked in close to midnight on our arrival and the Staff couldnt have been more Welcoming and Couteous. We had stopped in last year to have a look around  and decided on a stay rhis year. Great Service, a beaeautiful stay all round..Rooms ..Food..Views...We will defiantly  be back.",4
117,"Once a British entrepreneurial hub, history of this iconic monument dated back 1864. Being one of the oldest hotel in Asia, still owns that early prestige. ,Lunch buffet had a nice spread and was awesome. Little pastry shop have savories and sweets for a quick snack bite.,Memorise of the colonial era dispersed every corner of the building and have a library with handy collection of books.,Little sea water pool is a must try.,The magnificent night view of the Indian ocean is a great stress releaser amidst of busy Colombo.",4
118,"A lovely hotel that made a perfect first impression after a long flight. Rooms were a little dated but the poolside and bar were lovely - with ocean lapping alongside.,Staff were very friendly and breakfast delicious.,Wedding season in Sri Lanka- it was lovely to see one just outside our windoow",4
119,"we spent one night recently and it was a great experience.This is a historic property and hence one has to put up with small room space etc without being too ticked off.,the highlight for us was having breakfast at the patio overlooking the Indian ocean and this was priceless ! The spread at the buffet was good but the juices were watery.Try to walk on the park and see all the vendors with exotic food items etc and the morning sea breeze is uplifting.,it is pricey but woth the experience !",4
120,"I thought I had booked a  boutique hotel in Galle so to turn up at this super elegant colonial hotel institution in Colombo was a surprise, but oh boy - was it a happy one. Our suite room overlooking the crashing sea had everything we needed for a comfortable and restful stay after a long journey and before we started the rest of our trip around Sri Lanka. Buffet breakfast was one of the best I have ever had. Curries were fantastic. A bonus was the seafront grounds and pool with tradition of piping down the flag by kilted soldier at 6pm every day. Another was access to the colourful Galle Face Green, which has been the playground for locals since Victorian times, and itâs nightly street food - wonderful for a sunset stroll. Easy access to all the major attractions and railway station. Attentive staff seemed to match guests in number. Apparently freshly renovated this wonderful hotel is certainly calling me back.",4
121,Cocktail on the lawn and watch them pipe down the flag at sunset is a must in Colombo. walk through the hotel and check out the old photos in the bar is a walk back in history. the cocktails are superb and the staff very attentive.,4
122,"This is a beautiful old building which is located on the seafront in Colombo. The service from the staff was very good and they were only too pleased to help. Food was plentiful and lots of choice. Curries varied and spicy. The restaurant is lovely and gives an air of good times past. Room was large, clean and had the most wonderful wooden floor. All in all an excellent choice for our first night in Sri Lanka. ",4
123,"Located just between the âfortâ and the Indian Ocean, Galle Face hotel Colombo offers good rooms with good facilities, great swimming pool at the seaside, friendly and hospitable staff and a great spa. Good value for money!",4
124,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from 12 January, but unfortunately was taken ill and had to remain in my room for the following 2 days.  The lobby Manager, Mr Rakitha Amerasinghe was incredible.  His kindness and help was immeasurable and I cannot thank him enough for all he did for me - from arranging my medication to be purchased and brought to me as well as checking to make sure I was ok.  The original room I was give 3030, overlooked rooftops, so not the best view, but was moved to one overlooking the sea which was wonderful.  The reception staff were all very helpful, but the one person that The Galle Face Hotel should be really proud to have as a member of staff is Mr Amerasinghe.  Thank you for your caring.",5
125,"We stayed here 3 years ago and just had to come back. It's as splendid as ever. ,Great service, comfortable rooms, great food. What more can I say.,We had a corner room overlooking the sea and Galle face Green so that gave s great views. This was a Premium room but well worth the extra.(this is of course not a cheap place to stay.),I know its all a bit anachronistic but its great fun and a good base for exploring Colombo.",5
126,"Great hotel, very good food and excellent food. Slightly disappointed with the Cuban restaurant - lacking in ethnicity specifically the music.,We stayed there for two nights and we had a wonderful experience.",4
127,"Lovely historic hotel, with a superb location on the waterfront.,Just be careful you get a room overlooking the ocean, as we originally we placed in a very dark, lacking any atmosphere room with street noise.,We asked to be moved which was slightly better.,I guess with the hotel being historic, the noise of the wooden floors above can be very disturbing, as with the wooden stairs situated next to one of our rooms.,The buffet Breakfast was definitely a highlight, offering a fantastic array of food.,The gentleman armed with sling shot for the crows was a source of entertainment. Sling shot had the upper hand!!,The old bar with all the memorabilia was also interesting!!,Overall a nice place to end our Sri Lankan experience!!",3
128,"We stayed here for 3 nights, and although quite expensive, was worth it for the historical element which the hotel has lovingly nurtured. Nice touch that there is a resident historian, library and museum depicting famouspast guests - including the Duke of Edinburghâs car from the 1940s.,The food and service were as to be expected from such a hotel.,Would definitely recommend the hotel but our room was 2057 which I definitely wouldnât recommend. It had an adjoining room so when other guests were in their room it sounded like they were in yours; there was music underneath the room at times during the day which you could feel through the floor, but the worst aspect was its location right on the corner of the hotel next to the road. It was like trying to sleep on a motorway, and add to it the honking of the buses and police whistle blowing, it wasnât conducive to a good nightâs sleep!!,The photos are from our window",4
129,"Galle Face Hotel is one of the oldest colonial hotels in Asia. I stayed there over night and I was amazed with their architecture, service and all other facilities. They have maintained the colonial look of it as it is while making the stay so luxury.",5
130,"I loved the Galle Face Hotel. Its a beautiful heritage property and every part of the hotel boasts of luxury and old world charm. ,My room 1230 was big and spacious. The rooms are all different, I would recommend going for an ocean view more because the non-ocean views are closer to the busy Galle Face Road and the whole hotel is low rise so noise is more of an issue. ,In saying that, the location is wonderful, right by the sea and it feels wonderful to have your food while sitting by the sea side.",5
131,"So pleased to have eventually stayed at this historic hotel.  When we travelled to Colombo before the hotel was closed for renovation.   We had a beautiful room on the corner so facing the sea and the Galle Face.  Unfortunately beneath us was the newly opened Bamba bar which plays very loud music until 2am.  We tried to move rooms but were told the hotel was full.  This was the only thing that spoilt our stay, the staff are so attentive, food excellent, however if you donât get a good nightâs sleep and are paying a lot of money for that room it would be better to stay overnight somewhere else and visit for afternoon tea or dinner.  The whole ambience of the hotel has been totally spoilt by introducing this bar, which seems to be more popular with locals rather than hotel residents.  The two do not match and hotel guests are being made to suffer.",2
132,"This is a superb hotel with a unique history and outstanding position on Colombo's waterfront. The service is excellent and the quality of meals and drinks was very good indeed. Each night in the main restaurant was themed so that in addition to an excellent range of Sri Lankan dishes there was an alternative such as Thai with lots of choice. Drinks and canapes in the Long Room were very good although one of the days we were there was a public holiday on which no alcohol could be served.,Our room had  a premier ocean view and looked over the water on two sides and excellent views over the Galle Face green It was extremely comfortable and spacious. The hotel boasts a very agreeable (large) salt water swimming pool which was inevitably very popular. The hotel is large but manages to maintain a personal touch.",4
133,"Beautiful hotel steeped in history, as documented in the very interesting small museum within the hotel.    Many novels that have been written about Sri Lanka mention characters staying at this hotel.    The staff is very attentive.   Chief Concierge Emmanuel was especially helpful; after I unintentionally left a personal item at a hotel in another city in Sri Lanka, he coordinated the return of the item to the Galle Face Hotel and kept it safe until friends could retrieve it at a later date.     Try for a room overlooking the Indian Ocean and you will have a front row seat to beautiful sunsets, bustling activity around the large swimming pool and outdoor restaurant, and you may even see weddings taking place on the lovely grounds.    Access to the Long Room for afternoon drinks and appetizers is worth the extra money.",5
134,"The Galle Face Hotel is a very big hotel with a lot of wonderful history. We had a fantastic room with a balcony overlooking the sea and the pool. It has recently been renovated and there is a very interesting museum and a large buffet dining area, verandah bar and a fine dining restaurant, plus a poolside bar and snack area. The staff on the front door and the desk were most helpful and polite. ,We were disappointed with the buffet dinner, not something I would normally choose but the fine dining lacked atmosphere.  The area is quite lovely and colonial with ceiling fans whirring. I felt the staff too were disinterested in serving and were quite rude. On the other hand the staff at the pool bar were terrific and efficient. ,The pool is quite large but is deep - slightly shallower at one end but too deep for children who cannot swim. ,The hotel is situated right on the waterfront and is within close proximity to the city. Colombo is a fantastic city and very interesting and worth a couple of days to explore. ,I would definitely stay at the Galle Face Hotel as long as I had a balcony room facing the ocean, but, would take dinner elsewhere.",4
135,"A proper ""grand"" hotel with excellent service and comfort. We were there for two nights and spent our time gazing at the sea, wandering about the hotel (staff directed us to the fascinating museum and library - great places to sit and relax), watching the various wedding parties and enjoying the good food.",5
136,"The staff  were all very, very helpful. We had the delightful Ivoni Samanmali, Guest Relation Executive who went out of her way to please us in all our needs. Also Emanuel the concierge was a very gentle kind and helpful man who greeted us every day concerned of our every need. We would definitely go back. The hotel has a lot of character with many different areas to enjoy throughout the day besides it also being situated on the beach so many rooms have ocean views which is very welcoming. The food served for breakfast was awesome, plus this brought back many memories for us going back to 50 years when we were young. So, all in all it was magical, delightful and inspiring there are good gentle people still around.",5
137,It is not cheap but it is such a treat. We booked this because we knew we would have been travelling for 21 hours and wanted to be confident of a good hotel. We were not disappointed. We arrived in the morning and there was a room available. It was spacious and the bed large and sumptuous. We spent the afternoon by the pool. Plenty of shade available although being typically British we wanted to be in the sun. As you sit by the pool you are relaxed by the sound of the waves from the sea hitting the rocks. The views over the beach beautiful. We had drinks and food which were reasonable price. Outside of the hotel is the green where locals come to play cricket or do their exercises which was fascinating to watch. There is a short promenade along the beach where there are local cheap eating places. We didnât try them but we spoke to others that did and got good reviews. We hadnât booked accommodation for our last night but I am tempted to go back,4
138,"We enjoyed mojitos in the bar in front of the beach . The waiter was charming. We wandered in to the main area and then up to the hotel museum. This is very interesting- showing old vehicles and photos of past guests-even Che Guevara !,My friend's daughter had her wedding here.",4
139,"We had our wedding reception at Galle Face hotel on 26th January 2016 and they did an outstanding job at helping us cordinate the event. Everything from the food, the wait staff, rooms provided and the overall service was excellent. Special mention should be made of Mr Ujitha Peiris, Manager-Security and his staff who did an outstanding job of arranging and cordinating security for the event. He went out of his way to ensure that the event went ahead as smoothly as possible and handled the everything with extreme professionalism and attention. Banquet manager Mr Tuan and our coordinator Nimanthi were both very helpful too. We are extremely glad to have picked Galle Face for our wedding and would gladly recommend it to everyone we know. Thank you for everything.",5
140,This is a must stay hotel If you are in Colombo. Wonderful architecture and the room was beautiful. Outstanding service where I was made to feel welcome and high quality food. The rooms were clean and bed was comfortable. Thank you I will be back!,5
141,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights when we first arrived in Sri Lanka. The hotel was everything we hoped it would be - old world charm amidst the busy and bustling Colombo city. The room was understated and classically designed. We didnât fancy any of the modern Colombo hotels. There is a new bar and restaurant area called King of the Mambo which does lovely cocktails and food right by the ocean. The pool is large and you can properly swim in it. Very refreshing after a hot and muggy day. The sunset views were fantastic. Breakfast on the verandah was beautiful. Amazing selection of food, friendly staff and beautiful atmosphere. ",4
142,"Nice room with all you could need including en suite.  Lovely colonial era building with good ocean views, excellent restaurants and service. An oasis in a frenetic city.   Facilities include swimming pool, gym and library also a small museum.",5
143,"During our visit to Colombo we visited the Travellers bar at the hotel for lunch and a few cocktails. The setting and views are stunning. The hotel is immaculate. Even if you arenât staying here, I highly recommend you visit for drinks & lunch",5
144,Stunning hotel right on the ocean in Colombo.  We had the ocean front suite and you could hear the roar of the ocean all night long. Close to the Galle Face greens for a great walk along the ocean. The breakfast buffet was delicious and pool cocktails  yummy.  Great staff and overall wonderful place. ,5
145,Very nice hotel by the Indian ocean.  We stayed at the premier room with an angle view of the ocean.  Breakfast was excellent with the full view of the ocean.  Breakfast had traditional and western food items.  Room was clean and spacious.,4
146,"First stayed here over 20 years ago.. returned this week to find it still a beautiful piece of history... itâs been refurbished since we last stayed but it retains the colonial charm and the highest of standards that you could expect... ocean side location, salt water swimming pool and the most attentive of staff makes this a wonderful change from the often soulless modern competition..",5
147,"We had a very pleasant stay. The team is very helpful and friendly. Weâd like to extend our thanks to Emmanuel from the concierge as well as and the entire spa team for their professionalism, their kindness and their dedication for helping us having the best experience in Colombo ",4
148,"Great location but an old style colonial setting was not to my liking.,Wooden floors and thin walls mean you can hear everything in the rooms.,Poor buffet breakfast.... If you asked for any of the deli meats from your waiter you would get 1 slice.,Asking for porridge would take 20 mins+.,Buffet generally poor all day at any meal time.,Travellers bar the same along with the pool bar food.,The mambo bar thou was great and really nice food.,I was checked into the hotel for 40 nights but moved after 6....cinnamon far better",4
149,Went to Galle Face for a drink at the new King of the Mambo. It was Ladies night on Tuesday. They had great drinks: all free and free chocolates. Great music. Great service by Anton & David. Great views and amazing atmosphere. Highly recommend it.,5
150,"Very comfortable, personable service in a delightful old colonial British hotel circa 1864.  The service was exceptionally friendly, courteous and welcoming.  The customer service was warm and genuine.  The food was of 5 star hotel quality, with great variety, fresh and inviting, superb rice and curry as well as international cuisine.  The Long Room, Tavellers's Lodge and Verandah Bar all with spectacular views of the Indian Ocean.,Special thanks to the Hotel Doctor Galappathi and the nurse Mr Weerappulige who provided excellent medical attention to me after a fall.,Also, to Chaya for her historic tour, organisation of transport and other tours. Finally, to all housekeeping and restaurant staff who made our stay very memorable - thank you.",5
151,You are left in no doubt that you are staying in a historical luxury hotel. To underline it there is a museum and in the evening the flag is lowered to a bagpipe. Staff epitomise SriLankan people's friendliness.,4
152,"The Galle Face hotel is a top notch heritage hotel. The service was exemplary and the facilities very good, as I would expect for the price. ,The outstanding thing for us was the range of restuarant and bar options. The buffet was very good both for lunch and breakfast, the pool bar perfect for chilling out, the main restaurant excellent, the travelers bar refined and there was even a beachside Latino themed cocktail bar. ,Well worth a visit even if you're not staying.",5
153,"We stayed for 2 nights at the start of our visit to Sri Lanka, it was an excellent way to relax after a long flight. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the staff are pleasant, helpful and friendly. We were upgraded to a large, comfortable suite on arrival. Breakfast buffet was excellent, we ate out in the evening so I cannot comment on the evening meals. My only negatives are that drinks were rather pricey, and bizarrely there were no hooks in our room to hang dressing gowns or towels on!",5
154,"Positives,Great food, good service, lovely historical feel of the hotel. Pool and location are the reason you stay at this hotel!,Negative experience: ,We had a very annoying check-in at 1am in the morning - the room not ready and had to wait until 2am - despite calling twice to let them know we would arrive after midnight - however, manager apologized next day and provided free buffet lunch (but not drinks).  I appreciate the apology - however, the 1am experience highlights areas for improvement in staff training and process",3
155,"We had a wonderful stay in this hotel! we paid a bit more to be upgraded to a room with a balcony. Unfortunately the balcony faced to the side (see view but as well street view) and it was a bit too noisy for us. We talked to the reception and got another free upgrade to the other side of the hotel (older part). The room was superb, very large and it had a beautiful bathroom, it was also very quiet. I also had a facial treatment in the spa which was amazing and very professional. The breakfast buffet is very good but would have expected better coffee, the one we got was not very good with too much water. Overall, a super nice colonnial style hotel, would definitely come again.",5
156,Gave us a free upgrade for our two nights. Very spacious and clean room. Free buffet breakfast that served the best Sri Lankan food Iâve ever had (they also have many many western choices). They also offer buffet dinner for reasonable price which was also amazing. Only fault is that drinks prices were on he high end. ,5
157,"This hotel is seriously amazing! It was built in 1864 and very similar to raffles in style. We were unable to access the hotel with New Yearâs Eve so were greeted with a huge room upgrade in the kings premier suite which was magical. The bar downstairs is really awesome and restaurant, pool and spa brilliant. Our only regret was we didnât stay here longer. Iâd recommend 3 nights here. ",4
158,"We stayed at the Galle Face Hotel while entering and then exiting Sri Lanka. Amazing does not adequately describe the service and facilities at the hotel. Having made an error about our arrival on New Years Eve, the night staff found us a room, in a fully booked hotel, at 2 AM. We were so thankful.,On our second stay, the staff recalled our names, drink preferences and were beyond helpful. The rooms were spotless, the food was great and the security guard with the slingshot rustling birds away from the dinning area was spectacular.  ,What a fantastic hotel. We highly recommend it.",5
159,"The moment you check-in you realise you are in a place which echoes the past. It sells itself on its grand heritage and numerous eminent celebrity guests and politicians who have favoured this place above others.,The helpful staff help to ensure a relaxing stay, with good eating options and a first class sea water swimming pool that is hardly used. If you are a swimmer, this will make your stay. The little gym and spa area is Good for staying in shape, while trying to limit the calories.,A little bonus is that the contents of the non-alcoholic mini bar are complimentary.,Some of the facilities may need to be updated, but the food quality and value is excellent",5
160,"Staying at the Galle Face Hotel was one of the highlights of our trip to Sri Lanka. It is a very charming place and has loads more character than a non-descript modern 5 star hotel. We very much enjoyed the pool area and the service was always impeccable. The location is excellent and the sunsets are unforgettable.,However, we found that our room was in need of update. Although we were provided with a very large room that comfortably accommodated 2 adults and 2 children, in a hotel of this category (and price) you would not expect to have windows that need cleaning, loose floorboards, and a squeaky mattress/bed. On the positive side, AC and WiFi worked very well and the bathroom was gorgeous.",3
161,We stayed one night. Beautiful hotel to relax with the beach. Food was delicious.The staff were very helpful and the quality and variety of the food in the buffet restaurant was more than enough to satisfy us!!! All the best team and tc till i see you next time!!!!,5
162,"Our travel company Trailfinders booked us into Galle Face Hotel, Columbo for the first night of our Honeymoon.,On arrival we were greeted by friendly hospitable staff which was continued by all staff throughout the hotel. Because we were on Honeymoon, we were upgraded to a huge room with a four poster bed, massive bathtub and a huge sun terrace overlooking the pool & sea where we enjoyed the complimentary champagne whilst we rested after our long flight. There was also a free minibar with soft drinks and snacks for us to enjoy, along with the additional Honeymoon cake and fruit platter.,As we only had one night in Columbo, we walked around a few of the local sights including the Presidents House, Pettah Market area, The Red Mosque and the Dutch Hospital which were all within a short walking distance from the hotel. If you are looking for somewhere to eat away from the hotel, the Dutch Hospital is definitely worth a visit, we had heard good reviews about Ministry of Crab before we arrived but they were very busy the night we was there, so we ate next door which was really good also. ,We had breakfast in the hotel sitting outside in a undercovered area in which there was a great selection of breakfasts in a buffet style.,We loved this hotel and wished we could have stayed longer than the one night.",5
163,"We stayed two nights at this old classic hotel in the beginning of our journey.,We had booked three rooms near each others, unfortunately we had problems with two of the rooms: one room had only one window with view against the wall, and in the other room there was constant noice from the road outside (seriously loud!).,BUT! After some discussions with the personnell, both of these rooms could be switched. So all fine in the end! ,We spent New Years Eve at the hotel, a great experience! The buffet was the largest one anyone of us had ever seen and the food was amazing! ,The breakfast buffet was also great! ,The only problem we had, was that there were not enough sunbeds by the pool... we had a hard time getting chairs for all six of us... ,The gym was small but well-equiped. ,We recommend! ",4
164,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay at the Galle Face before heading off on our Sri Lankan odyssey. Although it is being swallowed up now by the Colombo construction boom, it still retains much of its old world colonial charm, and the character of its heyday in the early 20th century can still be seen and enjoyed.,The location is superb, being right on the seafront and opposite the public park where crowds gather at the weekend so it is full of life. Our room was large and well equipped with a lovely view down to the pool area and the seafront. The staff were very helpful and the quality and variety of the food in the buffet restaurant was more than enough to satisfy us.,I thoroughly recommend the Galle Face as a place to stay in Colombo especially if, like us, you have just arrived and are new to the country. The luxury and comfort helps you to unwind after a long flight.",4
165,"Lovely old world venue very well appointed rooms and a great feel and ambience,Great grounds and pool in a wonderful spot with a magnificent grand entrance and reception,Food was not of the same standard as the hotel with a fairly basic buffet and average a la carte",4
166,"Hotel rooms are getting tired, but still charming and serviceable. But the redeeming feature is location. Worth every penny for the absolute waterfront, seaside bars and restaurants, and the incredible history. Would visit again for sure.",3
167,"We stayed as family with 2 rooms over NYE. Was bit apprehensive with some lukewarm reviews about old rooms etc. I am glad to have ignored those.,It's a fantastic hotel. Rooms are great and service is excellent. Location and views are unparalleled in Colombo.,My title says all. ",5
168,"Very enjoyable stay at the Galle Face Hotel. Perfect location, comfortable rooms (on the smaller side) and beautiful wide Verandas to have breakfast etc ... Nice salt water pool.,On the -ives the hotel is looking a little tired in some places and could get some more deck chairs, umbrellas etc ,A clear choice vs the modern nondescript other 5star hotels in Colombo eg Shangri La",4
169,Fantastic heritage hotel that really takes you back in time. Staff is very friendly and gave a free upgrade to a tower suite. Even if you do not stay in this hotel I would recommend visiting it for a cup of thee on the veranda,5
170,"All employees were smiling and helping. My one and half year old son found many friends there and was very happy.The hotel's dining was good, and the restaurant was located across from the sea, and it was very good place to eat!we stay for a week and every thing was very lovely.",5
171,"Beautiful location , lovely building , great verandah dining and fine dining restaurants and travellers bar . Building loaded with history . ,However the rooms are typical 90s style , they totally need bringing up to date in a sympathetic colonial style . It was this that was disappointing and did not meet the expectation . Service could well have been better also for this class of hotel too",4
172,"The Galle Face Hotel was built when the American Civil War was still raging. Today it still commands what surely must be the best location in Colombo, and it looks better than it must have looked when it was new. Itâs been enlarged into ever grander proportions over all the years, while hosting heads of state, movie and sports stars, authors, adventurers, and other celebrities. It looks immaculate, and the staff achieves the highest levels of solicitous service.,On a recent two-night stay there, we had the opportunity to see the staff deal with a difficult situation. Weâd booked and prepaid our room through an online vendor (HotelQuickly), and we were horrified to learn that our reservation had been cancelled without any notice to us or refund of what we paid. The front-desk staff handled this unpleasant turn of events with extraordinary kindness and grace. They accommodated us in better quarters than we had booked but charged us no more than we had paid, then they helped us pursue a refund for the cancelled room.,Their evident kindness and concern enabled us to fully enjoy our time there. Most wonderful was the huge saltwater pool and the superb buffet breakfasts and dinners we enjoyed in the Verandah Restaurant.",3
173,"Spent two nights -- the first and last nights of our tour -- with a group. Nice location on the beach, beautiful old building, reasonably comfortable. ,If you are mobility challenged, or just don't like walking a lot, ask for a room on the second or third floor. As the hotel was built over a period of time, it's one of those ""you can't get there from here"" type of things. There is a direct elevator to the fourth floor from the rear restaurant lobby. But from Reception, the elevator only goes to the third floor...,A beautiful location for weddings, we were assailed with a lot of music and wedding noise our second night which interfered with our sleep. If you've got an early flight, ask for your breakfast to go. (We didn't know to do that.)",3
174,"Flew into Colombo and stayed at the Gale Face Hotel for a few nights service was excellent and the food was great. Our tour guide told us they were modelling it on Singapore as one could see by the buildings going up. Flew in Cessna 280B to Kandalama and went straight to the Dambulla Cave  Temple carve out of the mountain ,magnificent workmanship a World Heritage Site, then on to our hotel Heritance Kandalama an other great Hotel. Visited Minneriya National Park then on to Kandy and an other Temple of the Buddhas Tooth. Next stop was Galle where you see the stilt fishermen, and a visit to the Yala National Park saw lots of Elephants, then back to Colombo. In 15 days saw a lot of Sri Lanka from the very modern to native way of life even went tea picking the ladies that is guys just watched and took photos. It is a very interesting country even has a little english village in the heart of tea country Nwara Eliya ,homes are of Georgian  Queen Anne. Captains Choice were a great tour managers",4
175,"Definitely would stay here again.  Grand hotel with great service,  great food and a selection of bars.  Particularly enjoyed sunsets at the Cuban bar. ,Amazing history and stunning architecture. ,Rooms had been refurbished but in keeping with the historic ambience.",4
176,"One canât deny that this hotel with a beautiful colonial look is impressive! The ocean view even provides you with some relaxation (which you most probably need). The staff is also excellent and very polite. Plus, the food is delicious! Itâs definitely a place worth staying at!",5
177,"What a fantastic way to finish off our Sri Lankan holiday. After two weeks travelling around, it was  great to finish off with a bit of luxury. You canât help but soak in the history of this lovely hotel and there is even a small museum on the second floor which also contains a car that belonged to Prince Philip when he was stationed in Ceylon during World War 2. There are a number of restaurants to choose from - we chose to relax by the pool with a variety of snacks and appetisers as well as some delicious cocktails, so that we could enjoy the sunset and the flag lowering ceremony. The rooms were comfortable and very clean. The reception staff were very helpful and also arranged a late check out for us on what was a very busy day for them (New Years Eve). I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.",5
178,"A hotel that managed to maintain its charm ever since the colonial period. Itâs not only a beautiful building, but it also contains a great deal of history and traditions which the staff uses to engage visitors. I recommend it to anyone.",5
179,"Being one of Sri Lankaâs landmarks, this classical hotel facing the ocean is one of the most magnificent attractions of the city. Its staff is excellent, the service is very classy, and its location is quite convenient. Even their food is great and varied. If you ever go to Colombo, you must try staying at the Galle Face Hotel.",4
180,"Two young men who were particularly attentive with service at the GFH, were Dhanushke (especially so!) and Asanka, both from the Pool Bar.,The staff at the GFH are impeccable in their service and professionalism, and most people know this.  Hence, we wished to recommend these two gentlemen, in particular.",5
181,"The whole hotel oozes old Colonial charm. The terraces and public areas evoke a time gone by, the upkeep and maintenance is wonderful, everything looks immaculate. Staff are welcoming and helpful and look very smart in their uniforms.,Comfortable and spacious bedroom with furnishings that fit in well with the era. Big bathroom with separate bath and large shower. All expected amenities in the room, good free wifi, plenty of bottled water and even a free minibar with some soft drinks and snacks.,Great location right on the ocean and next to Galle Face Green which is worth a walk in the evening after the lowering of the flag bagpipes ceremony at the checkerboard. Pool area is fairly small but is nicely located next to the sea.,A good choice of bars and restaurants, afternoon Pimm's is recommended and the buffet dinner and breakfast were both comprehensive and very good quality.",5
182,"If you like the old colonial charm and a place overlooking one of the best ocean front,.. this is the place. Do not miss the sunset time there and happened to had a snack time with a couple who was on business tour. We were so much impressed on their location and services. It was the my second time that I had a meal and just stayed few more hours by sunset. Too beautiful now and worth that awesome feeling of colonial luxury.",5
183,"We decided to spend our anniversary night at the Galle Face Hotel and were glad we did. From the moment we checked in the service was immaculate. They upgraded us to a Junior Suite given that we were celebrating our Silver Wedding Anniversary. At dinner at the fine-dining restaurant 1864, they organized a delicious complimentary opera cake. Room was very clean and the amenities provided excellent. We would definitely love to stay here again.",5
184,"stayed here for 1 night before proceeding to the airport. It is a very nice hotel with pleasant staff and delicious food. Dinner was amazing. As we were leaving very early the next morning, breakfast was bought up to our room as it was included in our stay. Room was spacious and the non alcoholic section of the minibar was included as well. Would of liked to have more time here and would recommend to stay here.",5
185,"Lovely historic hotel. Travelled with 3 kids aged 21 months, 5 and 7. Had a large room with a sunroom separated by French doors which was perfect set up for us giving adults some privacy. Rooms were clean and well equipped, if slightly shabby. ,Highlight was the breakfast area, lovely sea views across the lawns. Only issue was that on day two the views were interrupted by a makeshift stage built for a wedding - I remember having this same issue when we visited 12 years ago. ,Pool also good although not ideal for young kids as no shallow end. But lovely position overlooking the ocean. ,Service was fine - not up to south East Asian standards but no major issues.,Would definitely stay again. ",5
186,"Our two night stay at GFH was truly memorable. The hotel is quite simply magnificent. Located right on the shoreline, the hotel has expansive views across the Indian Ocean and exudes old world charm. Just walking around the hotel transports you back a few decades and the foyer, the library and the stairway are a treat. After all, this is a hotel that counts Jawaharlal Nehru, Roger Moore, Rockefeller, Bo Derek and Yuri Gagarin. ,The 3 bed room we had faced the Ocean and was very spacious and comfortable. Offered a complementary bar stocked full of snack and soft drinks. The en-suite jacuzzi was fun too. ,The only aspects of the hotel service that we didnât dig were,- we asked for access to the desserts buffet at the Verandah (instead of the full dinner buffet) since weâd already eaten dinner. Told off right away. No chance of even trying to make something work. ,- we specifically asked for a lite takeaway brekkie bag and specified exactly what we wanted. Alas our pleas turned to deaf ears. We got what they wanted us to get!",5
187,Why oh why did we only book one night? Sadly this hotel was a treat on our simple tour of Sri Lanka but I would definitely recommend you stretch your budget. Lying by the pool overlooking the Indian Ocean for the afternoon was a highlight as was the wine cellar and breakfast in the veranda. If you love a sense of historical charm then this place is a must! A hotel driver took us to our next destination and his kindness when I fell ill enroute was touching. If I had the opportunity I would stay again and enjoy the warm hospitality.,5
188,"This hotel is in a great location within walking distance (a long but good walk) to Pettah and the Fort areas. The building is gorgeous and the pool is refreshing. The room we were in was a bit small, but had a great shower. The street food at dusk on Galle Face Green is definitely worth a meal. Cheap and amazing! Free local mini bar was good for breakfasts (juice and nuts etc.) Wifi was good.",4
189,"Loved the old world charm of the hotel.,Staff are very helpful and friendly.,My room was serene .loved the chair by the window with a view of the rolling waves,very therapeutic. ,Just outside the hotel is the famed GalleFace Green where you can catch kite flyers and locals enjoying time by the beach.",4
190,"We stayed for one night at the Galle Face Hotel. We were welcomed by lovely staff who made our arrival completely seamless. The hotel itself is beautiful and has lots of history and stunning views from the main restaurant and bar area. The bar/restaurant - King of the Mambo was excellent. It had a great vibe, live music, good food and great drinks. ,The rooms were good, but maybe a little tired. However, a very comfortable place to start ones experience of Sri Lanka. ",4
191,I returned to the hotel after many years and found it to be recognisable with traditional features.  It is somewhat grander  than before but has unfortunately succumbed to the package tourist market which has dulled some of the grandeur.  There is no longer a buzz but a rather resigned and impersonal approach to the provision of service which was disappointing.  There are other more enjoyable hotel experiences to be had in  Colombo but a visit to the Galleface for a cup of tea or a drink should not be missed,3
192,"For me this is the most controversial experience in Sri Lanka. ,On the one hand, the hotel is not bad and has a great historical background. Probably itâs one of the most interesting sights in Colombo. On top of all  they have a pool with a great view.,On the other hand, it is not worth the money you have to pay. The room was small and breakfast could have been better. Other hotels have better restaurants on their territory.",3
193,"The Galle Face Hotel is ine of the best hotels I have been too. It oozes charm like you would not believe.,The service and staff are fantastic and the setting over the ocean is superb.,I am returning there in mid January with family . I want to show them what a real hotel is like.",5
194,"I made a mistake in the date of the booking but the hotel was able to accommodate us. We took 2 standard rooms. Although we did not book rooms with the sea view our rooms on the ground floor did have a side view of the sea. The rooms are rather old and could do with some upgrading. There was a musty smell symptomatic of old building which have not been aired properly. Otherwise the beds were comfortable and the room came with the usual amenities. But the best thing was having breakfast on the Verandah the next morning. The Verandah is an expansive, unenclosed restaurant that opens out to a beautiful lawn facing the sea. The breakfast buffet has a huge selection of food with local and western offerings. The view is just gorgeous. The main job of  2 gentlemen in khakis on the lawn is to chase crows away using catapults!",4
195,"Picked up from the airport by a great driver arranged ahead of time. Communication with the hotel was excellent . Very warm welcome on arrival and upgraded to a suite . Good choice of restaurants and very affordable versus western 5 star prices . Rooms were spacious and well equipped and had terrific views of the sea, although the surf kept my husband awake ... j slept like a baby. Hotel arranged a great private city tour in private car  ($40) much better value than the 30$ per person charge with hip on hip off bus tour . Ate dinner first night and lunch second day in pool bar restaurant which was fab and tasty and well priced. Complete with local wildlife show ( chipmunks  and crows )! Donât miss a walk along the galle green promenade an area where the locals come to play ( a few interesting characters... snake charmers and monkeys ... although in chains ... not aggressive can take pics no hassle .. a gentle way to introduce teenagers to Sri Lanka ",5
196,"When booking hotels I always struggle between the wish for luxury and wanting to also experience history. This hotel booking was a result of history winning out. Our stay didnât start well with our agent promising a certain category room but paying for a lesser one. The hotel however rectified it and despite me offering to pay for the upgrade, gave it to us complimentary. We ended up with an ocean view suite which was lovely. ,The hotel breakfast is buffet and adequate with both English and Sri Lankan options. It has a great little gym and beautiful spa. The staff here however are what make the stay very pleasant. ,If I was the GM of that hotel ( a game I play often!) I would rip the car park out at the front and have a grand circular driveway with gardens. The facade is so beautiful it is such a shame to spoil with bitumen and cars. Iâd also offer champagne in the long room rather than sparkling. ",4
197,"Grand property right at the ocean front in downtown Colombo. Open uninterrupted views of the ocean. Refurbished but maintaining its old luxury ambience and British heritage. Large rooms, very tastefully and simply done. Great service consistent with the hotel of its caliber. Excellent spa. ",4
198,"We stayed at the Galle Face Hotel for the final night of a 2 week holiday in Sri Lanka in December.,Itâs a 5 star hotel, but only met my expectations given the room rate and the rating.,We were at first allocated a room overlooking Galle Road, but were immediately changed when we complained about the loud road noise on that side of the hotel. Our new room was perfectly adequate, but plain for a 5 star hotel. Having been told at reception we had a âcomplimentary minibarâ, it was almost comical to find that included only a couple of soft drinks and some nibbles.,The hotel itself is a lovely example of colonial grandeur, but itâs rapidly being swamped by the development of mega-hotels nearby.,The breakfast buffet was fine: geared towards western tastes, but the local food weâd eaten throughout our holiday made it seem pale in comparison.,One massive high point was the proximity to the street food vendors on Galle Face Green. If youâre up for it, theyâre great.,My rating is âaverageâ because this hotel met expectations, but no more, and Iâd stay again, but I fear its heyday is passed.",3
199,"We had a beautiful room with a view of the ocean, loved the 30m saltwater pool and the choice and quality of the eating places and bars (great cocktails, too).,All the staff were extremely nice and helpful, especially Nadeesha at the reception. They were very accommodating when we needed to extend our stay for a later check-out.,The unique setting directly by the ocean letâs you forget the mad bustle of Colombo. I would never stay anywhere else in the city and am leaving with a heavy heart.",4
200,"Very nice colonial hotel. Very friendly and helpfull staff. Great buffet menu for breakfast and lunch. High quality cocktails to enjoy whilst enjoying the beach and sunset. Spa facilities are also very good. ,The only thing if you suffer allergies is that given that it is an older beach hotel, there was a musty smell in the suite room we stayed in. Also, the suite room would benefit from some minor upgrades to lift up the grandeur of the room.,The library, museum and restaurant are all very nice.",4
201,"Galle Face - Not to miss beautiful sunset,Good place to relax and enjoy the beach n beach snack food. Nearby good shopping n malls n cafes,Nearby good hotels,Old Dutch Hosp nearby, good pkace to get quality items n souvenirs. Fix price shop.. Cultural dance on sime nights in Old Dutch Hospital. Burger King is nearby.",4
202,"Wonderful character Hotel, full of old world charm. We stayed here for one night as a treat before flying home from our trip to Sri Lanka and we were delighted with the experience. From the moment you check in, all the staff look after you so well. Lovely pool bar with spectacular sunsets. Excellent Buffet lunches and breakfast, so much choice, it will suit any taste. I would love to stay here again in the future.",5
203,"The Galle face hotel is located right on the sea. the rooms are large, the bathrooms even larger, the food is excellent, the bar on the waterfront and the coffee shop have stunning sea views and the staff is very courteous and the hotel is centrally located. The spa is outstanding and highly recommended. ",5
204,"Enjoying a wonderful stay in this fabulous ex colonial wonder.,The whoâs who of previous guests, Yuri Gagarin to Che Guevara! amongst many movie and other stars gives you a hint of a long and splendid history, which is worn lightly with excellent service.,Apparently the British accidentally shot the hotel while testing one of the canons they inherited when taking over Sri Lanka from the Dutch (colonialism 101...). Appropriately close to shooting oneself in the foot. ,Breakfast curries outstanding, all five of them!",4
205,"Visited the hotel for a corporate event (awards night followed by a dinner) and the food was quite average or even below par in some dishes. The seafood cocktail was nice and we had a few of them just to fill in for the otherwise disappointing food spread. Overall, not a great dining experience.",3
206,This hotel is an oasis of calm in Colombo. The staff are lovely and the food and views are gorgeous. And a proper size pool too. Would definitely love to go again.  But book with them directly on their website - I had problems with my booking through Booking.com.,4
207,For an insight into wonderful history see the in house museum. Sitting outside after a lovely lunch with nothing to do but watch the waves crash on the shore. There used to be a huge chessboard outside.,4
208,"We stayed for 4 nights in Nov 2018.  We had what I think was a basic room without a balcony but it was excellent.  Large and grand with a fine bathroom.  The hotel can only be described as grand.  All the public rooms and spaces are high class.,Excellent housekeeping provided every day by Keith.  He was also an excellent source of tourist information, providing us with lots of info on the Hotel and Colombo in general.,Breakfast was a treat every morning in a smart setting overlooking the sea.  Great food and great choices.  All staff were really friendly and helpful and we were particularly impressed with the smiley gentleman patrolling the grounds to frighten off the crows who came looking to steal food by waving a catapult.  He was great fun but unfortunately I can't remember his name. , We always returned to the hotel's beachfront bar at night after visiting bars and restaurants elsewhere in Colombo and there cannot be a finer end to the day anywhere than sitting out there watching the waves crashing in whilst enjoying a final drink.,Highly recommended.",4
209,"Galle Face hotel has an unbeatable location right on the ocean's edge. The splendid architecture oozes history. The hotel is like a mini museum. It has hosted many celebrities and luminaries in past and has some memorabilia from its illustrious past. The rooms are nice and well appointed. Service is warm and friendly. Food is excellent. Compared to other 5-star hotels, it is pocket-friendlly.",5
210,We only visited Colombo briefly but it was recommended by our guide to visit the Galle Face Hotel around sunset. We were fortunate as we arrived just before the cricket finished for the day so we were allocated a table for four with a wonderful view from the colonial style balcony out to the ocean. The service was excellent and the sunset spectacular. We were also treated to the lowering of the flag by military personnel. The cricket supporters arrived soon after us and provided great interchange of travel and sporting tales. A most memorable experience.,4
211,"Wife and I stayed  for 10 nights, primarily in SL to watch cricket, chose this hotel on TripAdvisor feedback.,Pro's- Great location looking out across the sea, you can eat/drink at the bars here and have an ocean view.,Hotel appears well managed and maintained, staff very friendly and helpful.,Food and drink offerings excellent, quality very good. Breakfast was included and we used the buffet for evening meal 7 nights, expansive by colombo standards,  but food very good.,Our room was fine, clean, AC and a ceiling fan. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Shower excellent.,Mini bar ( no charge) is stocked with water, soft drinks and snack on daily basis.,Pool area is adequate in size, 25m salt water pool very clean.,Cons - bit churlish, but expected a little bit more for the cost room wise. Booking expeditions and taxis comes with a premium. ,Will be back in 2020 and will look at the costs at the Galle Face and compare with the surrounding  competition. But no reason other rhan cost not to stay here.",4
212,"After staying in most of Colomboâs main hotels, I have found my favourite. If you are coming to Asia and want to experience something unique, this is the place to stay. Unsurpassable and unforgettable. ",5
213,"stayed here after going around Sri Lanka following the cricket. An oasis of rest in the busy city of Colombo, wonderful staff and a beautiful colonial style hotel.,Take the hotel tour, the guide is full of knowledge and a nice guy to chat to.",4
214,"Public rooms (outdoor restaurants and bar, indoor restaurant, library, museum and meeting rooms) are pleasant and well cared for. We enjoyed the huge breakfast buffet and the food at the restaurants within the hotel, which was well prepared and reasonably priced. My room, in the old section, was a bit hostel-like with a plain white bed cover, no pillow shams, a very small framed print and little else. There was a smell of mold. More could be done to make the guest rooms in this section equal to the decor and comfort of the public spaces. I appreciated the mini-fridge with snacks and lime drinks, and the fresh fruit and cookies. Overall the team working here seems very dedicated, pleasant and professional. We did have a negative experience with a hotel-based ""city tour,"" which was  basically a drive through town with very little information given and a stop at a jewelry store. Concerns addressed to management via e-mail have not yet received a response.",4
215,"Went for tea during a cricket visit. Stunning hotel, top waiters, lovely service - friendly and attentive. Food was simple but delicious we both had club sandwiches and beer. There is also a BBQ outside.A must visit if you are in Colombo to see the lovely Colonial building.",5
216,"Stayed 2 nights as a a stop over between the test matches in Galle and Kandy. Public rooms were amazing. Like being on Agatha Christie set. Excellent buffet breakfast, overlooking the ocean, with added entertainment of a man with a catapult to scare away crows. Comfortable room with complementary soft drinks and snacks. Had a very enjoyable evening listening to live music in hotel's pub, the In on the Green.",5
217,"This is a top hotel of the world..easy to compare with eden roc in south of france,The rooms are amazing..the food is amazing and the whole colonial feel in a 5 star environment makes it so special,From the moment you step inside the hotel you realize that this place sets the standard.",5
218,"Our first hotel out of 5 at the start of a Sri-Lanka tour. A big colonial hotel which oozes charm. Lots of nooks and crannies to explore include a museum with black & white pictures of everyone who has stayed there. Good priced cocktails available at a bar overlooking the sea soon swept away our travel fatigue. Lots of places to relax and variety of food on offer. Fantastic breakfast and a piper played to the lowering of the Sri-Lankan flag at sunset. Lovely room and thank you for my husbands birthday cake. Staff were all fantastic, lots of smiles and nice to have doors held open. My only comment would be its easy to get lost in some of the corridors.",5
219,"This is an amazing hotel and worth a visit with loads of colonial era features ,However we were given a room above the world's noisiest wedding and thevwho place literally vibrated,We were offered a different room but only after we were in bed and we decided to stick it out The Â£30 compensation offered added insult to injury given what it cost to sat there ,The hotel needs to decide if it is offering a 5 star exoerience or is just another noisy wedding venue,Please check about weddings and room location before booking ,Howard and Wendy Platt ,Cheshire UK",2
220,"We stayed in this hotel our first night in Sri Lanka, and it was excellent. The hotel has a lot of history and the receptionist kindly organised a short tour for us which was great. The rooms are very comfortable and the bar lively with good service. All in all would recommend it. ",4
221,"This not to be missed Colombo classic with a majestic view of the Galle Sea Face still carries the grace and memories of its hoary past. Unfortunately, that age also shows in most of the hotel; and most of the rooms that we saw, were also strangely cramped for a hotel of such vintage. Still, for a big hotel, the food and service remain very good!",3
222,Spent a couple of nights here at the end of October.  Beautiful old colonial style hotel in a great position.  Had to move rooms due to the noise coming from an adjoining room but all handled very professionally and we ended up in a lovely room.  Buffet breakfast was great as was dinner.  Staff very attentive.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  ,5
223,"Our group spent a couple of nights here at the end of a two-week trip around Sri Lanka. It was a fitting end to a great holiday. We really enjoyed the ambience of the hotel, spacious rooms, food and service. It's also worth doing the free guided tour of the hotel and see interesting things like Prince Phillip's first car!",5
224,"The minute I saw this hotel I knew I it was going to be good and it was. It is a beautiful colonial hotel right on the beach. We only stayed one night but we made the most of it. We were planning to go out for dinner but once we saw the location and the menu decided to make the most of the location and dine in. Accommodation, service, food, pool, location were all fabulous and it was just up the road from Spa Ceylon. What more could you ask for?",5
225,"It felt like I have taken a step back in time, this hotel is a very grand old girl.  I was lucky enough to have a room that was over the pool and facing the Ocean.  The food menu and service was five star but there is a Bar at the front of the hotel (facing the street) that was quaint and cosy and a must do.  The in house Spa is a MUST to all that visit.  The best hotel spa experience I have ever had.",5
226,"We stayed 2 nights 9/11 & 10/11/18 on a Trip organised through Trevin Reid of Viluxur Holidays Colombo  who organised a Room Upgrade with the Booking. The Hotel is absolutely beautiful, it has been lovingly renovated keeping its many classic historical features, it is in a fantastic location on the Indian Ocean front with superb views and beautiful sunsets - we hadn't planned to dine there at night but the atmosphere, great views, friendly service & lovely food made it too hard to go elsewhere. It was one of the loveliest places we stayed in our 12 nights in Sri Lanka.",4
227,"An historic hotel that gives you a feel of days gone by. It has been renovated and looks good. The room lay out seemed strange and less than optimal.,Amazing ocean views at a breakfast with a wide variety of selections. Pleasant and attentive service.,An oasis in the city of Colombo.",4
228,"The Galle Face is in a beautiful location on the edge of the Indian Ocean and next to the open  s pace of the Galle Face Green. A step away from the bustle and busy outskirts of Columbo.  The hotel displays all the aspects of its history, and there is a museum within the hotel which a little patience will allow you to find. The facilities are good, catering is great, pool is a decent size and deep.  Service is great and everything is very good value.  As always hotel laundry is good value.",4
229,The hotel is located between a busy road and the beach. Place has a unique historic vibe to it. Food was excellent in their seaside restaurant and the service was great. The place has been visited by such unique people ranging from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to Scarlet Jhonson!,5
230,"Our friend who lives in Colombo suggested we go to the outside bar at sunset.  This was fun and we sat in a comfy couch sipping adult beverages and eating snacks.  The service was lovely, and the interior of the hotel amazingly upscale. We enjoyed this experience before heading to dinner.  ",4
231,"Very decently updated old hotel; ( in itself not easy, nor to replicate old world style and location on sea-face),rooms very comfortable, spacious, good amenities great housekeeping. Staff all round courteous.Breakfast buffet especially nice - huge selection: easy to over do it! (Donât understand those who complain about selection). Other meals also good to excellent. Wait staff might communicate better. Spa was nice. Beach is tiny. ,One of our rooms was in the north-east corner- more street noise, and noise from I gather ballroom below- so recommend avoid those rooms  if possible. ,Some super common areas/ museum.,Great location for Colombo area ; would stay again even though there are newer options close by.",4
232,"extremely friendly and welcoming staff... the 'museum' is very nice and the photo gallery has a lot of interesting celebrities.,The buffet was not bad and reasonable in price but can do with a bit more options and servings",4
233,"went for high tea, 2200 per person, server explain about food, but the quality of food is unacceptable, around 12 varieties were there, but tasteless, we were expecting  good, tasty food,..... but relay disappoint,",4
234,"We had an excellent stay in Gale Face Hotel, the very first in this part of the world. Magnifique in his colonial style. The room with a balcony over the sea. The staff is very friendly . The bar and the restaurant also t very good. They have also Ã¡ Cuban restaurante with great guacamole!",5
235,"Stayed here for a few nights at the start of our holiday in Sri Lanka. Itâs an iconic hotel in Colombo and has an old world charm about it, but has kept up with modern standards and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. Our room was large and airy on the side of the hotel with a sea view. Kept spotlessly clean, the linen and towels were great quality as youâd expect. We had access to The Long Room as part of our rate which was lovely in the evening for a cocktail to watch the sunset. We used the buffet breakfast which had everything you could want and more, and also used it for an evening buffet - a great way to try different local food and curry. The staff were very friendly and helpful especially the concierge who helped with ordering cricket tickets. The pool is very welcome after a day of sightseeing, but has very few sun beds which seemed to be reserved from early morning so we only used it for a dip to cool off. The lounge bar is nice for lunch or an afternoon cup of tea. We really enjoyed our stay, itâs an oasis of calm in a very busy, noisy city. ",4
236,"Stayed here for one night on arrival to Sri Lanka. The check in took such a long time after a long flight which we felt was ridiculous and unnecessary.,The rooms are quite tired looking despite the grandeur on arrival hence the four star rating.,The staff were very helpful and breakfast was splendid with ample choices for all palates.",3
237,We spent 4 days and had an amazing time. Hotel is colonial style and Rooms very comfortable and restaurants great with a lot of variety. It is away from the chaos of Colombo and right on the beach. Staff helpful and friendly.,4
238,"Colonial style hotel which has very spacious accommodation and surroundings. Water front location, but you are advised not to swim in the sea. However, there is a good sized pool with adequate sunbathing areas. Very friendly staff who were extremely welcoming and willing to assist as required. Our room was very spacious, but noisy as at the side of the hotel adjacent to the A2 which is a busy road both night and day and the locals do like to use their horns! Recommend you ask for a water front side room which may not be quite as noisy. Great breakfast buffet which covers all requirements. Although we did not eat dinner, other guests we spoke to said the food was delicious. If you are looking for something different to the major hotel chains then this is definitely worth considering. ",4
239,"Emmanuel the conceirge went all out and way beyond his duties to help us get cricket tickets..even after we had left the hotel...,So impressed. Truly amazing.,A lovely hotel full of history but he made this stay so special ",5
240,"I love a good historic hotel and whilst my budget wouldn't stretch to staying at the Galle Face Hotel (and sadly there's no listing for their bars so I have to write in the hotel listing instead)  I absolutely adored the hour or so I spent there last weekend, sitting in the comfy lawn chairs, sipping my surprisingly reasonably price cocktail and listening to the ocean. We checked out the indoor bar with the amazing black and white photos of the great and the good (and a few not so good) who've stayed there. Who would ever imagine to put Indira Gandhi and Scarlet Johansson next to each other? There's also a set of tables under the ceiling fans but we opted to sit on the grass by the chess board.,This place is just so beautiful that I really would be tempted to blow the budget next time I go to Colombo.",5
241,"This hotel is one of the reference in Colombo due to heritage and historical background. However prices are really high and not in adequation with the quality of rooms, quality of service and especially in comparison of the other hotels around the place...,I would not recommend to go unless you are invited, and even with this, you have to check everything in the room because maintenance is really poor (electricty, shower tapped, cleaness of equipments).",2
242,"Booked the hotel for 1 night, we were booked on an early morning flight home so only intended using it as a base for our last afternoon and a shower, change of clothes and general chill out. Arrived with a back pack each and was shown to room by a bell boy who then stood waiting for a tip for showing me how to turn on the lights. There was no WiFi in the room, contacted reception who told me due to lightning there was a problem and it would be sorted. Waited a while and nothing. Went for a walk around the area and returned to shower. My wife went in and complained of no hot water. Again contacted reception who were going to send someone up. 45 minutes later, nothing so I set off to reception. By utter chance I met  a maintenance guy in the corridor who called someone, they reset a pump and within minutes hot water flowed. Went for food, in the bar, nice area and food was tasty. ,Checked out at 10, said about my general unhappiness to the fellow at the desk who passed me onto a girl standing beside him to complain. I guess it is a nice hotel but seriously let down by the people who should be the first point of contact. ",1
243,"Whilst this is a great hotel in a good location, we found it extremely noisy. There was a loud party going on below us with a booming bass shaking our room until last midnight. The hotel didnât seem to care too much when we reported it to them. This was a quick stop over for us. The room was clean and tidy. Bathroom beautiful and internet sufficient. Restaurants and bars lovely. Be careful, the tiled floors are very slippery, particularly when wet. ",4
244,"One of the oldest and colonial style hotels in downtown of Colombo facing the Indian Ocean and picturesque sunsets, accompanied by bagpipes tunes at 17:00. Proper and fresh breakfast with a view, super kind hotel staff ready to assist. If you are a big fan of colonial style and good traditions - this hotel is definitely for you!!!",5
245,We stayed here for 3 nights during the England ODI tour of Sri Lanka. From the moment we arrived staff could not have been more helpful. Throughout our stay everyone greeted us with a smile and often wanted to talk to us about cricket. The room was a delight with an enormous bath in the middle of it. It was extremely comfortable and the fridge was well stocked with complimentary snacks and drinks. As soon as we had eaten these they were replenished free of charge. Food was delicious breakfast dinner and lunch snacks. The choice and presentation was exceptional. The history of this hotel must be seen. Overall a fantastic place to stay.,5
246,"Positives:,Beautiful architecture with the ancient touched designs,Friendly & helpful staff ,Beach is like literally 10 feet away ,Negatives: ,The food menus could improve a bit as I didnt see a good selection (my opinion anyways)",4
247,located centrally in Colombo with direct beach access. despite an ongoing conference the check staff managed a quick check in. Special mention to Emannuel - the Concierge with immense knowledge not just about Colombo and who with a quick smile got us a reservation in one of the best restaurants in Colombo - effortless he make it look. Left us with a memorable experience!,4
248,We stayed for a lovely four nights at the Galle Face and wish it had have been longer! They staff were welcoming from arrival to departure with friendly greetings throughout the day. The rooms were clean and spacious and maintained to a high standard. The buffet breakfast is a must for anyone staying as it caters for the pallet of east and west at its best! Take the time to check out the many ammenities and be sure to enjoy a cooling cocktail by the pool as you gaze out into the Indian Ocean ,5
249,"This hotel is perfect if you wish to experience how the other half lived in old Colonial Ceylon. It has the most charming people, spectacular views and simply stunning furnishings. The rooms were so pretty and everything was wonderful. Highly recommend it for something different in a city that has traffic jams beyond any expectations.",5
250,This hotel has a very good history and colonial feel to it when you walk through the door. Lot of celebratities has stayed here in the past and it has an amazing buffet in the evening. It is perfect for large conferences and business events and good transport links to the airport.,5
251,"Hotel: colonial style, very special atmosphere, efficient, new, spacious,Rooms: spacious, new, clean, complete, nice view,Food: delicious, friendly staff,Staff: friendly, open, big smile from Wajira,Location: centre of Colombo, near to colonial part of Colombo and shops",4
252,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in a Junior Suite with a sea view.,This hotel is very old but well maintained With a great deal of character.,The food is very good, staff are very attentive and courteous and the rooms and general areas are kept very clean.,There is an almost endless list of famous people who have stayed here in the past and on the second floor is a small museum that houses the first car bought by the Duke of Edinburgh when he was stationed in Sri Lanka whilst in the navy.,All in all this is a very good hotel in a great location which we would have no hesitation in recommending.",4
253,"This is a colonial style hotel and one of the originals of this type in the Far East. It is in the same mould as the Peninsular in Honk Kong or Raffles in Singapore - but less pretentious. Colombo is more laid back as a place. It is not one of those five star modern hotels which now exist in Colombo and where further new hotels are shooting up with a 1000 plus rooms each.,Galle Face is large and traditional and a little worn. That said the buffet on the terrace for breakfast or lunch are good value (particularly if included as part of your package) with a warm sea breeze and there are two other restaurants and a beach bar. ,Rooms are a modest, reasonable size and most over look the sea.",4
254,"Stayed a night at this hotel on landing in Sri Lanka and before heading off to Galle. It's a beautifully done up hotel and the staff is very courteous. The breakfast spread was amazing and it was actually difficult to choose!,We got an upgrade when we checked in, so it started pretty well for us!,Do walk up to the little seating outside, facing the sea, and soak in the view, it is mesmerizing!,Would absolutely recommend the place!",5
255,This is a classy hotel that knows how to do things properly. Book a junior suite as they are terrific as is the understated yet ever-present excellent service. The pool is lovely and wonderfully devoid of any piped music. I will most certainly return.,5
256,We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed exceptional service. We originally booked a junior  suite and was upgraded to a Heritage suite. The 1864 restaurant was a little slice of heaven with a good wine list and we enjoyed dinner there twice. ,4
257,"On our recent trip to Sri Lanka we stayed here and absolutely loved it,Itâs a great place for many reasons, great location, very clean, excellent and very helpful staff from front desk to restaurants to room cleaners, concierge etc.  The colonial ambiance gives it the Grand feeling, the lovely long corridors are great for relaxing in the sea breezes, and the food in all the restaurants is very good.  We booked a Premier Deluxe ocean view room which came with so many complimentaries like happy hour everyday, breakfast, a complimentary dinner each and an all inclusive mini bar with snacks and drinks. The room we had was large, spacious and quiet with very comfortable beds.  Having stayed in a few good hotels during our stay we would absolutely recommend this without a doubt if you intend staying In Colombo.",4
258,"Thanks for service. The resepsionis is very kind, helping me fast, food is delicious and spicy.  Meeting room is the best, room is big and clean, view (sea), kind man and kind woman especially for Nadeesha. The hotel is the best. Antique hotel. I want to back in this hotel in the next time",5
259,"Very friendly staff, loved the room. Didnât like the step in/out of the bathroom. A light in the toilet would be a good idea, rather than having to turn all the bathroom lights on in the middle of the night. Pool and pool bar were great. Big selection of food at breakfast. We struggled to turn the tv on, not sure if it was just us. Great location. Than you for a lovely stay. ",4
260,"We stayed here at the end of our trip to Sri Lanka, it is a beautiful old hotel full of charm and atmosphere. In the  travellers bar there are photos of famous people who have stayed there in the past. The hotel in on the beach front so even when you are sitting in the terrace bar you can here the sea. There are lots of seating areas to choose from. The rooms are clean and serviced very well. Breakfast is a buffet which has foods from around the world so something for everyone. We had really good cocktails in the travellers bar. We had the buffet on our last evening. This was very good with great choice. The staff were all very helpful. I would recommend the hotel.",4
261,"We stayed here for two nights and loved the old world, colonial atmosphere.,Dark wood floors, whitewashed walls and lovely simple furniture.,We deliberately chose this hotel over several other more modern chain hotels in the area and we did not regret it.,The staff are very friendly and helpful.,The food is good (we ate breakfast both mornings and dinner one evening).,The pool is spectacularly located looking right out over the water though there isn't really a beach and we were warned not to swim in the ocean! There is a working port not too far away and a large land-reclamation project though this did not in any way inconvenience us.,Most of all we enjoyed the location right on Galle Face Green which was full most evenings with people walking, eating at the food stalls and playing frisbee or volleyball.,We walked all over the city and felt perfectly safe.,We did have a problem with our room and had to move for the second night but there was no issue and the staff moved our clothing and luggage to the other room within half an hour. Highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Colombo.",4
262,We were a family of 5 and took an Interconnecting suite and room. The rooms were enlarge and perfect for our family of 5. The beds comfortable and clean. The hotel has a library and a Long Room that was delightful from drinks and canapes. The pool was a saltwater pool albeit small. There is a tiny patch of beach but otherwise there is no direct access to a beach. Breakfast was delicious and I am in love with hoppers and Sri lankan delicacies. The staff were always helpful and the museum of past famous visitors is really worth a visit! Our family had a lovely holiday here waking up to the sound of the ocean at our window. Would highly recommend and would come back always .,4
263,"We stayed here for three nights when we were watching the final cricket game. We did have a problem with our room booking when we first arrrived and it was sorted and we were able to check in at 10.30 am. ,The room wasnât large but had lovely decor and a great bathroom. We spent a couple of days by the pool which was lovely, and had lunch at the pool bar try the curries they are fab.,We drank in the Travellers bar on a night and found the staff and ambiance fabulous, I would recommend a pins cocktail, gorgeous,The only compliant I do have is the noise on a night, we were by the road and could hear the traffic, also there were some inconsiderate people above us who seemed to spend most of the might stomping about on the wooden floors, really annoying,The breakfast was also very lovely and a great spot to start morning, I had Sri Lankan breakfast chicken curry, Dahl and roti,We would definitely recommend this place it is beautiful and full of history",5
264,There is best view to the beach in the evening and can see the sun down from the Terrence. They have nice high tea which is starting 3.30 pm. Still maintain the traditional look from the British time. Hotel is colonial Style and there are many restaurants to dine- in. There is nice pool facing beach and also the pool side bar.,4
265,"We stayed here for 1 night on our last night before flying back home. The building is fantastic, however the rooms are quite small and noisy. The atmosphere is fantastic, however not all staff is that service oriented. E.g. checking in took too long. Perhaps because of the age of the hotel it misses the luxury and comfort of modern hotels. At least it was a great experience to stay here for a night!",3
266,We arrived very late at night and were delighted to discover we had been upgraded to the Ceylon Suite. It was huge and full of old world charm with fantastic views from three windows  to the sea and onto to the Galle Face Green. The bath could have fitted two people in it easily. The staff were fantastic and the breakfasts were delicious.,5
267,"We had a quick visit to Colombo and booked this Hotel based on previous reviews and photographs. The room was fairly basic but clean. We were not disappointed by the quality of service or standard of food. We loved the colonial feel of the Hotel lounges and outside bar and restaurants with their ceiling fans. The pool area was right next to the beach which was really good, though swimming in the sea was not recommended. We used the Pickme App to order both Tuk Tuks and Car to the airport as itâs hassle free and fees are not expensive. Itâs location was close enough to the center of town to either walk or use a taxi. We even met Boney M who were staying in the hotel while performing in town. Would not hesitate to stay again.",4
268,The hotel was awsome i had my uncles wedding thete great food and desert awsome we had alot of fun the rooms were great the sound system also were great i love the desert very much a best place to visit super hotel ,5
269,"The hotel gave us the wrong room at check in. When we pointed this out, they switched us to the junior suite that we booked but the room was filled with termites on the walls, windows, furniture, and blankets. We told them about the termites immediately but we spent the night because it was late and we were exhausted. The next morning, we asked for a new room and they upgraded us to the Scandinavian Suite which was very clean and no termites. ,The manager Siddique is amazing. Take the heritage historic tour of the hotel, itâs free! The sunset drinks and snacks in the Long Room are delicious and a great view of the ocean at sunset. Breakfast is amazing.",5
270,"Centrally located and facing the sea, this hotel takes good care of you. Internet speed was fast, especially if you are travelling for business and need to stay connection with overseas. It was my second time to this hotel and I will definitely return. ",4
271,"Plenty going on in this historic hotel, with weddings occurring on a daily basis. Rooms in the southern wing are more than normal average size with  bath and shower. Rooms look right down towards beach frontage and you literally go to sleep listening to waves crashing on the beach.,Extensive and excellent buffet, which varies each day.Only disappointment were the cocktails which were decidedly ""weak"".,Multiple levels if building mean some steps if you have limited mobility.,Excellent staff, watch for the ""slingshot boys"" on duty near the buffet lounge.",3
272,"A wonderful hotel that offers an experience of colonial history with a dash of elegance and comfort. Comfortable and clean rooms, polished surroundings and an extremely enjoyable cocktail terrace and whiskey bar should guarantee an enjoyable stay. The breakfast array was also very impressive. Great stuff!",5
273,"The Galle Face Hotel is not your typical hotel. It is a heritage destination, a living museum steeped in history at every corner. Relax by the pool with a Pimms, dine on some of Sri Lanka's best cuisine and immerse yourself in Sri Lankan culture on the streets of Colombo.Galle Face Hotel should be on every travelers bucket list!",4
274,"Spent the last night of our Sri Lanka holiday at the Galle Face Hotel- and it was a wonderful way to end the holiday.  It is a colonial period hotel- apparently the oldest in SE Asia.  Itâs been very well maintained with beautiful furnishings, carpets, decorations. There are 2 main restaurants - a pool/ bar/ restaurant and a larger restaurant. Seawater external pool with sun beds around which was lovely, all overlooking the crashing sea which is just spectacular and so lovely to be by.,There is a large spa area, which looked lovely- used the jacuzzi in the changing area- but all very good quality.,Buffet breakfast excellent. ,Bedroom nice, simply furnished in a period style. Comfortable bed.,The hotel is more about the âexperienceâ rather than anything else and the sense of history.,Staff very good- helpful and professional. ,Would definitely go back when next in Colombo.,Service/ sleep quality 5/5,Rooms 4/5",5
275,"A must do when in Colombo. Either stay or dine in. We were three persons with two sea side suites. Access to club level with beautiful Hors D Oeuvres during happy hour. Beautiful large rooms with the sound of the sea ever present. Wide hallways reminiscent of days and architectural style long gone. Buffet was huge, plentiful choice both local and international. Breakfast was a long lingering affair. Historical tour including the hotels own museum was well worth the time and really introduced one to the hotel and environments. The seaside pool is a gem.  So is the senior citizen, suited ""crow shooter"" with his sling shot. The Galle Face Green and all its ambience abuts the hotel.",4
276,The first glimpse of the hotel will set you back if you are not expecting a colonial hotel. They an have excellent property right by the sea . Everything in the place is well laid out. Special mention has to be the thoughtfulness to introduce you to some local Sri Lanka products by giving them free in the room . The spa is also superb . Evening coffee or beer by the sea side or poolside is an amazing experience as you watch the sun go down. Mesmerisingly beautiful setting. Equally friendly staff ! Beautiful experience. ,5
277,"We stayed at this beautifully restored hotel fir two days and nights. The aim of staff is to make you feel at home. From the sumptuous bed linen, beautiful meals, great service and salt water pool, they certainly achieved their aim.",5
278,We were told this is a must do on any trip to Sri Lanka and I have to say their breakfast buffet was outstanding. The walls of the hotel's bar are jammed with photos of celebrities past and present who have chosen to stay here. The building is quite magnificent and must have been an incredible sight back in the day. I must admit though I was a little disappointed. I thought it would be a far more luxurious stay. Our room was small and the furnishings and fixtures seemed tired. Also the pool area seemed in a state of disrepair and not somewhere I felt comfortable to laze.,3
279,"This renovated Colonial Hotel is a must for a stay in Colombo. Location, atmosphere, service just perfect for a pleasant stay. Big, comfortable rooms. Wide and good offer for meals, snacks, drinks throughout the day. ",4
280,"The hotel's location, its architecture and tradition have impressed us again.The hotel service is excellent. The same applies to the areas pool, spa and gymnastic.We have really enjoyed the stay. We can highly recommend Galle Face.",5
281,"Lovely hotel. Great Food and a wide selection to choose from. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Unfortunately for me, I was on a 10 night business trip so didn't get much time to explore the hotel, but from what I checked out, it looked great. ",4
282,"This time it was the annual general meeting of the newly restructured conglomerate 'Ambeon Capital PLC', made me to visit the 'Galle Face Hotel', right on the beach and in the heart of the Colombo, the most prestigious, desirable destination  in the city for memorable and special events like weddings. ,The Chairman of the company is Mr. Sanjeev Gardiner, Group Chairman / CEO of 'Galle Face Hotel Group' too. Gardiner family is with this heritage hotel property ever since Mr Victor Vicarosso, the great grandfather who had became a shareholder of the company hundred years back.,The meeting was held at the South Wing, which houses many restaurants, bars and meeting rooms, also a small museum which displays a car, once owned by none other than the Prince Phillip of Greece who became the Duke of EdinburghÂ after marrying Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the II.Â This Flying Eight was a car launched by the Standard Motor Company Limited is in pristine condition and quite a treasure for the hotel. Also could be found a listing of renewed personalities around the world who have walked and stayed inside its walls. ,Well, for the annual general meeting all requirements are provided in house, with modern efficiency, warm hospitality and a touch of elegance. Their service was impeccable and the afternoon tea selection of sandwiches and cakes were delectable. ",5
283,"My first stop on my Sri Lanka Adventure. After a long flight via KL, with delayed departure (courtesy late passengers!), my driver/guide, the excellent Iresh from Khiri Travel, drives me to the Galle Face Hotel. At close to 1am the staff were helpful and efficient. My ground floor room is ready and charming. A huge double bed and massive ensuite bathroom said âcome inâ! A great start to my holiday!,Next day breakfast is a huge buffet style affair, with attentive staff taking care of every little thing....including the elderly bird watchers who scare off unwelcome crows etc with personal sling shots!  Great tea (naturally, itâs Sri Lanka!) and coffee, huge fruit selection and delicious omelettes! Yum!,Galle Face is steeped in history, right on the beach and in the heart of Colombo. The Verandah Bar is the perfect spot for a pre or post-dinner gin&tonic! I love this place!",5
284,"The hotel itself is a historical building and is worth a good visit. Our room was upgraded to premium thanks to the good hotel service. The room was spacious and nice but the wall was full of small tiny micro bugs. The bugs, if Iâm not mistaken, comes from damp area. There was a loud bang in the middle of the night and I could hear water falling off like shower. It was noisy. Then, they decided to spray insecticide at around 4am which was very noisy. I could not get a good sleep from the noise. Other than that, the service was excellent",3
285,"My boyfriend and Iâs favourite hotel in Colombo for a splash of luxury before venturing the country. Highlight of this trip was access to the long bar for drinks and canapÃ©s late afternoon which was included in our stay of a suite room. One of the best breakfast buffets in Sri Lanka, perfect dhal, egg curry, hoppers and so much more. Check in isnât always an easy process as experienced on all 3 occasions, hence 4 stars. FYI for a single night stay they take a refundable deposit of $300. We stayed in the Scandinavian Suite. Will return!",4
286,"Wow such a nice stay ,Service was outstanding the manager allowed as to have a very late check out at no extra cost which was fantastic as we had a dick child and also were able to freshen up after a hot day eight seeing,The went out of their way to be helpful and efficient,The rooms were very comfortable quiet roomy with complimentary drinks and food in the mini bar,It was a great position right next to the the water great sunsets and not far to the old Dutch hospital ,thank you so much galle face hotel ,For making our stay so pleasurable",5
287,We were told that this hotel would be such a highlight..  sadly this the opposite. We have stayed at so many great hotels in Sri Lanka and this one is  no where near the standard as lesser starred hotels. Outside our room the roof is poorly patched the door does not close properly and then the baths hot water tap did not work.. the tap was fixed  after 9pm by engineering we did not worry about the door. The hotel room is the smallest by far on our holiday plus this is the first hotel we have paid seperate tax and service tax.. add about 30% extra to any purchases. ,2
288,"Very nice surprise, we had two nights stay at Galle face hotel, and you immediately feel and see the history here. In a good way ;),Great service and overall experience but the cafe  and breakfast leaves wishes for improvements considering the place and reputation. ",4
289,"Had cocktails and nibbles over a few hours listening to the ocean, the food and drinks were great with excellent service. A highlight was the bagpipes being played as the flag was lowered on the beach at sunset. Seriously this hotel oozes class. ",5
290,This beautifully restored hotel offers all the charm you would expect. The staff are excellent. The vista is beautiful and we enjoyed our drink before going to dinner. Breakfast was terrific with great choice.,5
291,"We stayed for one night during our honeymoon. This is a very grand hotel and the history very interesting. ,You are greeted by the staff in their very smart suits, holding the door open and taking your baggage. They really cannot do enough for you. ,We were treated to fizz, cake, chocolates and fruit in our room on arrival.! ,The room is very clean and looked after. Our view from the room looked out to the swimming pool and also the sea. ,The sunset was amazing! ,We are at the Inn on the green and took part in the quiz night whilst there. ,We both had burger and chips - very tasty. They have happy hour offer on drinks too! ,Would highly recommend. ",5
292,"This hotel is broken down in several ways. Since it is an old British-era building bult in 1857, all floors are wooden. Not only do all the floors creak, so do the doors, cabinets, etc. You can hear creaking noises from other rooms as well, making it very annoying. ,The staff at the F&B outlets forgot how to smile or never learnt. Menu at Dinner buffet is almost 80% same as the breakfast buffet. They have done away with their infused cocktails which they used to be once famous for.,The only positive is that it is the only hotel actually on the beach.",4
293,"I always stay in Galle Face in Colombo. This is the best start you can have for your trip.,Beautiful antique pieces of furniture, astonishing views and such a relaxing atmosphere.,The rooms are amazing and the food is delicious. ,I recommend everyone to at least experience this amazing place once.,And I bet, you will return !!",4
294,"Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Rooms and bathrooms are clean and comfortable. The hotel is in a great location next to Galle Face Green, with spectacular views of the sea and sunsets from the 2nd floor bar/terrace. We really enjoyed our stay and would go back.  ",4
295,"I had stayed at this hotel about 7 years ago when on vacation with my daughter.  This time I returned with my husband and  close friends for a wedding (not at the hotel).  We were not disappointed.  I had opted for a premium room this visit, which did not disappoint.  It was quite large, with two beds, a large bathroom, separate room with toilet & washbasin.  Absolutely lovely.  And the big plus, you have use of the 'Long Room' on the 2nd floor, which has refreshments available all day, without additional charge.  You can sit inside or out, with a view of the ocean. And 'happy hour' drinks are also complimentary from 5:00 - 7:00.  What more could you want?  Both breakfast and dinner are very good with lots of choices.  The staff are very attentive and extremely polite.  My husband and I are British, but live in the US.  We and our friends loved this beautiful colonial hotel the best of the 6 hotels we stayed in during our visit and tour in Sri Lanka. The hotel is right next to the ocean and you can get down to the water, but really there is no beach.  Nice to be next to the water though.  ,I will most definitely return to this hotel when visiting again.",5
296,"This hotel is a must visit place for any traveller visiting Colombo. Think Raffles in Singapore. It is steeped in history and even has its own museum. The Verandah bar has photos of the famous people who have stayed at this hotel over more than 100 years. It is even better to stay there. I had a room on the second floor that opened onto a marge verandah overlooking Galle Face Green. The room was very spacious with a large, modern bathroom. It was excellent value for money and having had 3 nights there, I canât imagine staying anywhere else. The staff are courteous , friendly and helpful. Smiles everywhere. ",5
297,Arrived in Colombo for 24 hrs. Fantastic old charm colonial hotel . Friendly staff wonderful attention to detail . Delicious breakfast . Great location on the Halkw Fsce Green overlooking the sea . 10 out of 10 ,5
298,"We booked this hotel because of the history and reputation and we were not disappointed. The room was comfortable but I personally would have liked face towels and body lotion as part of the room amenities. The staff were great in general. Breakfast was good and so was the service. We spent quite a lot of time at the Pool Bar and we really donât think the service was up to standard here. We ALWAYS had to flag down a waiter, even if there were only 4 people to serve. For a hotel of this standard, I expected a bit more from the food. Especially the light meals and Room Service... All and all a great stay and will definitely stay here again...",5
299,"It was my first visit to SriLanka and obviously had few butterflies in my stomach, although it is not the first time, I am flying out of India. ,Location is one of the biggest advantage of this hotel, right on the sea shore. The employees were fantastic and were volunteering to help the guests.,When I was checking out at 12 noon (as per their guidelines), when they came to know that my return flight to India is only in the night, they offered to keep the baggage in the hotel and complimentary refreshments facilities before going to airport, when I return back to the hotel after a sight seeing trip!",4
300,"This is a hotel that takes you back decades to an age of opulence and grandeur! The rooms themselves are furnished in a way that lets the hotel down a little as they are somewhat sparse...other than that this place ticks every box. When I stay in a luxury hotel I try to avoid the recognisable brands as you could, quite frankly, be anywhere. When you stay at The Galle Face Hotel you know you are in Srl Lanka, in fact the place makes you think it's Ceylon again. The breakfast buffet is one of the best with local and foreign choices. I became a huge fan of chicken curry for breakfast. The hoppers are freshly made....sensational.,I'll be back for a gin and tonic!,This place deserves to be up with other Asian flagship grand dames in hotels!",5
301,"Marvelous place indeed...definitely not in the same category as most so-called heritage hotels round the world...Galle Face belongs to a highly exclusive club with distinguished and equally legendary members in Bombay, Singapore, Kyoto, Penang, Bangkok... a legend kept alive with the second to none sense of hospirality Ceylan was known for and Sri Lanka has taken to new heights. Great location, impressive old days architecture, highly professional staff, delicious food, serene atmosphere, marvelous indeed ! Congratulations to GM R.C. Hauck, all my gratitude to AFO Manager M Siddique and special thanks to Lalit at the Long Room who is a model of dedicated attendant. Ambassador PLG.",5
302,"Galle Face Hotel might be showing itâs age a little but it still delivers a solid hotel experience. ,Food was fantastic, the staff helpful and friendly and the rooms clean and spacious. ,The pool and spa facilities were top notch, and the hotels WiFi one of the best we experienced while in the country. ,Would definitely return!",5
303,"This Hotel takes you back in time. The colonial layout is refreshing with its open views of the ocean. The rooms a neat and clean, staff friendly and helpful. Baffet breakfast has a available a wide range of Sri lankin and western foods",4
304,"The hotel faces the ocean and receives ocean breeze in eating and swimming areas. Rooms are large with high ceilings. Comprehensive breakfast. Attentive staff. Has an interesting museum of photos and artifacts pertaining to the hotel's past, including Prince Phillip's first car.",5
305,"I have been a visitor to the wonderful hotel since 1979. This historic hotel has a great sea facing location and excellent rooms and facilities, including a museum celebrating is many royal and celebrity guests. Founded in 1864 when Colombo had overtaken Galle as Asiaâs first port of call, and before the Suez Canal raised Bombay as the most popular entry to India, Ceylon was the stepping stone to Madras and Calcutta! A sting of stunning hotels emerged including the Calcutta Grand,  Cecilâs in Simla, The Bombay Taj, the Maidens in Old Delhi and later Imperial in New Delhi!,All great places, the Galle Face, the oldest, still stands as NUMBER ONE!",4
306,"Hotel is situated overlooking the sea, absolutely beautiful location.  Overall service was excellent with very friendly staff. Also, has a beautiful spa and definitely worth booking a treatment. I would definitely stay here again on my next trip.",5
307,"First time I visited this hotel 30 years ago, It is right at Indian Ocean and its front is great park called Galle face. It has amazing Sea Food Restaurant, one can choose and get cooked. Fried Prwan were amazing, Grilled Saloman was good",5
308,I had my daughter's wedding at galleface hotel jubilee ballroom on 13th september 2018.It was a wonderful wedding ceremony. The hotel staff gave their fullest corporation.they were very friendly and helpful. Food was delicious and guests were very happy. Even the ashtaka gUru and traditional dancers provided by the hotel was excellent. And the kitchen staff was also very good. We were offered lunch prior to the wedding to taste selected food items from the menu. That meeting with the kitchen staff was wonderful. Even the coordinator of the banquet hall and the staff served there did a wonderful job. And the bagpipers were excellent. Reception and the security staff too gave their fullest support. Banquet managers were very supportive. Our sincere thanks should go to them specially the head of weddings. She was very helpful. Everything was done in a timely quality manner. A big thank you to galleface hotel for making my daughter's wedding day a pleasurable memorable and a beautiful one.,5
309,Helpful kind staff. Bed very comfortable. Delicious breakfast buffet. Nice happy hour with snacks on veranda daily. Room well equipped. Only negative was the room was kind of dark and hard to see in closet. Otherwise wonderful place to stay with great location and historical feel!,4
310,"A very luxurious hotel, with exceptionally friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. We enjoyed a walk along the sea front and dinner in the hotel was delicious - a highly recommended place for those who want to relax and enjoy Colombo.",4
311,"This hotel is a nice place to stay.  Our housekeeper was extremely helpful in providing the services we asked for.  Getting to your room provides plenty of exercise.  As it turned out, I celebrated my birthday week there and was surprised by a delivery of cake and cookies on the day.  I will say, the cost for breakfast is not cheap.  The Veranda is wonderful for having lunch or dinner.  We were fortunate enough to see the Miss Sri Lanka pageant.",5
312,"This was a great way to finish an top tour of Sri Lanka. The service was excellent, especially at the reception. The pool and bar on the sea front offered a great way to relax. Get to the bar early to watch the sunset, as the tables get taken up fast. Also, you can witness the lowering and raising of the flag to bagpipes from here. Thank you for making the last few days for us together so smooth",4
313,We stayed at this wonderful hotel for 2 nights at the start of our Sri Lanka road trip and were very impressed. We had a lovely spacious room with very efficient air con. Very good buffet breakfast. Fabulous meal in 1864 restaurant one night and took full advantage of happy hour free drinks and lovely snacks in the Long Room! We received outstanding service from Mr Imran and Concierge Emanual who spent time with us showing us round the hotel and resolving some travel issues for us. All staff were excellent. Thank you for a lovely welcome to Sri Lanka.,5
314,A friend who lived in Sri Lanka suggested taking the time to go to this hotel. So glad we did. Such a wonderful experience.  We had a buffet lunch overlooking the ocean. The ambiance would have been enough but the food was off the charts. So many wonderful international dishes to choose from plus Sri Lankan cuisine. The desserts were amazing.  Definitely was worth it to spend the afternoon here. Service of course was top notch.,5
315,"We were very luckily upgraded to a Junior Suite which was amazing. The hotel is beautiful and super luxurious. It is certainly worth what you it charges!,The staff were super friendly with excellent English. Included breakfast was varied and delicious. Pool was great with wonderful views! ,We were there for one night as a fancy end to our holiday and I would definitely stay again if we had the opportunity. ",5
316,"We were very pleased to have this hotel in the heart of Colombo as our last stay of our 3 week tour around Sri Lanka. We had taken the 8 seater plane from Trincomalee and arrived a little bit early to check in, but they found a room for us within an hour and it was an upgrade to a junior suite, although somewhat tucked away through the spa downstairs. As it was our last night, we enjoyed a fabulous meal in the 1864 restaurant which was quite special. The following day we were due to catch a late plane, but the normal checkout was at 12 and we were able to use the facilities of the hotel, including the absolutely fabulous swimming pool, until we left at about 6. We had a wonderful cocktail in the Long Bar whilst a multicultural wedding took place outside by the sea. Got picked up by the bus trip outside - thanks to the helpful reception staff- and had a wonderful time on the sandy green next to the hotel, watching hundreds of kites being flown by the locals. A speciality on Friday and Saturdays, late afternoon. It was a delightful place to be.",5
317,"Donât go here if you are expecting faultless deco. This is a historic 1860s hotel. It is luxurious. It is beautiful but it is not pristine. ,The staff are incredibly helpful and rightfully proud of their hotel. Breakfast is an experience in itself. Hardly wanted to leave the hotel all day. ",5
318,"We stayed here with our two kids on our way back through from traveling Sri Lanka.  The staff were amazing more than happy to help in any way they could.  The breakfast buffet is amazing and so is the lunch, the food is very nice.  Such a beautiful place with so much history and we will be staying here again.  It isnt far from being able to go and do things in Colombo itself and definetly a kid friendly place.",4
319,"We booked two rooms at the galle face hotel as we were 4 guests travelling however one guest cancelled last minute. So when we got to the hotel we upgraded our two rooms to one room where we three would fit in and we were told the only additional cost would be a roll out bed in case we thought the two queen beds were not sufficient. Over time it turned out we were being charged for the third persons breakfast, happy hour - even though we were told breakfast and happy hour was complementary. Each hotel staff told us different things and were extremely confused.so make sure you claify any booking amendments with hotel staff multiple times. In terms of hotel - itâs a beautiful hotel with great views and a nice swimming pool.",4
320,"A lovely hotel with lots of character and old world charm.  The staff are welcoming,  well mannered, helpful and efficient.  I was a single traveller who had family dropping in to see me during my stay - they made a point of welcoming my visitor and making them feel equally welcome.,The pace of life in the hotel is a welcome relief from the bustle of Colombo, but the central location of the hotel means that you can jump into the busy city in seconds when you want to.,The selection of food in the restaurant and bar is excellent - all tastes are catered for and provision was made for diabetics and guests with gluten and dairy intolerances too.,The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. ,I really enjoyed my stay at the Galle Face Hotel and would recommend it to anyone who wants a relaxing stay in a hotel with history.",4
321,"This grand Colombo hotel is special. I love the architecture and history. However, I find the office and admin a bit to be desired. Make sure to visit the traveler's bar and see the pictures of all the famous previous guests. I think the new wing has better rooms than the old wing.",3
322,Attended a conference here- not good weather but the hotel was very elegant and with an old world charm. Beds were very hard but I enjoyed being able to open the windows. Right on the beach even though you canât swim. Walk to markets and restaurants.,4
323,"I was visiting Sri Lanka with 9 of my friends from the US (all of them white) and it was very interesting how the front desk lobby staff was always distrusting of me (dark-skinned Sri Lankan). They only give one room key (I was sharing a room with two others), so we had to leave the key at the reception desk so that we can each go our seperate ways and grab the key from the reception whenever one of us returned. Each time I went to ask for the room to my key, they Sri Lankan (similiarly dark-skinned staff) would always look at my somewhat suspiciously and ask ""madam, are you staying at this hotel?""...a question they never asked any of my white friends. I think it is high time Sri Lankans look at their own racism toward their own kind. Other than that, the hotel is generally fine. Decor is beautiful. The breakfast buffet was great. The room was just okay. The bathroom faucet made a loud creeky noise for the first few minute of running water. Staff was not nearly as warm and friendly as the other hotels we stayed in throughout our trip.",2
324,"We only had a brief stay in this beautiful old colonial style hotel due to a delay at the airport with lost luggage. Although it was the wee hours of the morning we we arrived, the staff welcomed us warmly & surprised us with a special little âwedding anniversaryâ cake, & some small treats. Breakfast on the lovely open air section facing the ocean was a refreshing relief after our long day/night before, with a wide selection of foods. The staff continued to help track down our lost luggage. We returned to this hotel on our final afternoon, just to have a couple of sundowners & watch the sun set over the ocean. We enjoyed watching their sunset ritual of lowering of the flag complete with a piper! Recommend.",5
325,"Five friends flew into Colombo late at night and were collected by the hotelâs bus service which was great. The hotel itself is stunning, well located and historic. The breakfast buffet was extensive with both local and western options.",4
326,An excellent location for peace and quiet.  Room was comfortable and large. A la carte menu delicious. A choice of fine dining or casual. Staff were friendly and helpful. Gin and tonics were expensive but one had to partake in this very British establishment. The Reading Room was very interesting. Hot water bottle placed in bed for the chilly nights.An experience to remember. Within walking distance to shops.,4
327,"Not all rooms have ocean views but visible from dining areas and pool, Room was spacious,comfortable and functional. Mini Bar with soft drinks and snacks was complimentary (nice touch). Staff were friendly and efficient. Walking distance to main shopping area along beach front (10-15 minutes) and also shorter walking distance to shopping center with supermarket on ground floor. Some interesting features/events:,1.Staff member armed with sling shot on duty in garden area to warn off crows and squirrels. 2. Flag raising and lowering ceremony with bagpipes twice a day at morning and dusk.",5
328,"A great hotel full of history and character with beautiful furniture and prints and carvings going back to 150 years. ,It is very comfortable and the rooms are big and has all modern facilities ,The staff are attentive and welcoming ,The food is ok but could be better ,The location is brilliant with a brilliant sea view and it is next to the green",5
329,"Amazing hotel and we are still here. I've stayed in the cinnamon grand and lakeside which are great hotels. However the galle face wins hands down. Plus side is the staff are more than fantastic, but when there is a wedding normal guests are forgotten. The bufee was meant to be a Thai night but was left overs from the night before all for Â£70 for 3 for below par food. And the wedding music might as well been in our room.,I might sound a whinger but have a 5 month old who screamed for 2 hrs. Again hotel and staff are great and 5 ... I would change a few things but deffo come again.. but would check for weddings.,5  for the staff!",3
330,"An incredible collection of memories from the past - it's like walking into yester year! A huge complex with so much memorabilia it will keep you wanting more.,Top location. Incredible service and attention to detail. A must stay if you like,the era of the colonial past.",5
331,Very good room with beautiful balcony best staff everybody ready to help anytime.lovely breakfast..I had early flight they arranged taxi and breakfast.old classic building..thank you very much we will return soon.,5
332,"Pros,- Excellent location,- Nice hotel in  well maintained historic building,- Walking distance to good restaurants,Cons,- Smallish rooms,- repetitive food,Conclusion ,- Good stay in a well located hotel in the city center.",4
333,"My girlfriend booked us in for a nights stay in this amazing colonial place prior to heading home. Sheâd read about it in the âTea Planters Wifeâ book. ,We had the suite with balcony and ocean view!!! Stunning. The rooms were fab. ,We had a lazy 2 days here apart from myself having had a workout in the small gym. Lounged by the pool and drank. We wanted for nothing more. ,We went to the 1864 restaurant for a nice meal, and that it was! Opted for the Chicken and Pasta dishes as main courses. The wine selection was extensive, and some great choices on there. We managed a bottle of the Riesling. ,Breakfast was incredible, loads of choice on the buffet.,The only negative was when asking how much a car would be to the airport was they told us 6,000Rps. We did some some research and got a lift arranged through Kangaroo for 3,000Rps. ",5
334,"My wife and I spent a day/night in this beautiful hotel during our Sri Lanka trip and it set us off in the right start.,It was a pleasant surprise to be updated to the ocean view suite upon check in; room was spacious and the view was amazing. It also came with the sunset cocktail at the Drawing Room.,Conveniently located next to the Galle Face beach (where they hosted the international kite festival during our stay) with a panoramic view of the Laccadive Sea, and vicinity to the Dutch Hospital Shopping Precinct, where the popular restaurant ""Ministry of Crab"" is located. It was a pleasant 25 minutes walk with nice sea breeze in the evening; alternatively you may call a Tuk Tuk to take you there. Hotel staff shall be able to advise the right fare range. ,Breakfast and lunch at the Veranda were a joy with the ocean backdrop and a wide range of food choices from local to international and they were nicely organised. The food was yum.,This is an establishment of its own with 150 years of traditions of hosting famous guests including royalties, head of state, and famous personalities; there is a well curated hotel museum documenting them - recommended a visit if you have time.,Service was overall friendly however there were some inconsistency in terms of warmth.,This is the hotel of choice when in Colombo.",4
335,"Stayed as part of a conference.,Staff attentive and helpful the foyer and rooms are very well appointed. Food is amazing and the Veranda breakfast room has everything you would dream of to eat at breakfast.,Amenities superb pool lounges and gym,Great central location in Colombo and easy access to great restaurants",4
336,This hotel is a tourist attraction in it's own right.  Great service - willingly met our needs.  Beautiful old colonial hotel steeped in history. Fabulous location and setting by the beach and Colombos famous Galle Face.  Breakfast buffet was included in the room fee and was fabulous with both western and local dishes.  This was a stand out hotel in my experience and I recommend it to anyone visiting Colombo.,4
337,"Stayed here for two nights with 12 family members.,Lovely colonial style hotel room was lovely. ,Staff very friendly and food was amazing! Lovely pool area to relax next to the ocean ,I would highly recommend ,Will be back ",5
338,"Great Hotel, great food, friendly staff. Little disappointed as room wasnât ready and we arrived at 11.30 at night. Also pool service was slow. 6 staff, one making our cocktails and the other 5 watching. ",4
339,This is very old hotel in sri lanka and also  more beautiful place very nice view specialy sea views staff very friendly food was good service also excellent this our fourth times in this hotel we definitely come back ,5
340,"Where to begin? Everything about this hotel is excellent! The rooms, the service is wonderful, the pool is divine, the restaurants are delicious and the cocktails (try a Vivien Leigh!) are amazing. I promise you will love staying here. The history of this hotel is worth a look at in their own little museum that is beautifully presented. You can also do a tour of the hotel but be sure to book as it does not run every day. There are some great places to eat around town but you'll want to make sure you do some eating and drinking here too! Do not miss happy hour for hotel guests with free (yes free) drinks and yummy nibbles. Select your own seafood at the restaurant by the beach (eat indoors if it's hot!!!). There was a large group of us for dinner and the seafood restaurant staff suggested letting them make up a meal for us - wow!!!! most delicious and beautifully cooked individual seafood platters!",5
341,"Last year my wedding function was held in the Jubilee Ballroom of this wonderful hotel. Then, me and my husband had the privilege to spend our night in a cosy, colonial, simply furnished suite with a huge tub with hydromassage. From the preparation to the actual day of function, the banqueting staff followed me very well. Everything was organized in detail and the food was really tasty! I had the chance to taste before the function, the food that was prepared for my big day. This was really helpful for me to adjust everything according to my taste. After the long day of the function we relaxed taking a long and romantic promenade at the seaside and we really enjoyed the free buffet dinner at the restaurant outside the hotel. Everything was simply perfect and romantic! Moreover the location for the wedding photos was fabulous! We also enjoyed the rich breakfast that the hotel offers while watching the sweet squirrels that are used to come to the restaurant sometimes! I really recommend this place for a function but also for a vacation! ",5
342,"I stopped over for 24 hours at GFH en route to my best friend's wedding in HK. Colonial style ambiance right on the shore of the Indian ocean. No beach but nice pool available and massage facilities on lower level. Food adapted to all palates, native and local. Will return.",5
343,"Staff was very professional especially in welcoming us. They gave clear explanations and take time to present all the services with a special touch as they provided hand written nice welcome cards. ,The rooms were great, aligned with the standard of the hotel. We had ocean views. ,The renovation is great success for this historical place.",5
344,"This hotel was the gift that kept on giving. We arrived too early to get into the room but were able to have coffee and relax on the awesome terrace of the Travellers Bar, surrounded by the sights and sounds of the ocean only metres away. The service was at all times excellent and although the hotel is proud of its significant past it was able to offer us access to the most up to date technology to do some necessary work. Our room on the 3rd floor was small but beautiful and very well appointed but sadly without a view of the ocean. In the evening we met friends in the bar again and witnessed the unexpected but magical evening ritual with the bagpipes being played as the Sri Lankan flag is taken down for the night. We thought this couldn't be beaten for spectacle but we were then treated to Kandyan drummers welcoming a bride and groom in to the hotel for their wedding reception which was amazing. The following morning we had a lovely breakfast on the terrace and watched a uniformed member of staff, armed with a slingshot and a keen eye try to keep the crows at bay. Another fantastic and totally unique side to this wonderful hotel.",5
345,"Spacious rooms and old world charm,Friendly people,You canât find this type of hotel elsewhere in Colombo ,Beds in the new wing could be of better quality and the mattresses werenât good,Bathroom was good but beginning to look a little old,Safe didnât work at first,Saying that would stay there again",4
346,The hotel and room was beautiful. Sitting at the travellers bar or on the verandah. The only reason I wouldnât give 5 stars is the drink and food service is very slow. There arenât any female staff at all. I think this hotel lacks the closer attention to detail given by female staff. ,3
347,A friend and I stayed here on our last night in Sri Lanka . What an amazing way to finish. The service was over & above. We were flying out early in the evening and they were kind enough to let us store our luggage after checkout ...and let us use their facilities (including the most amazing ocean side swimming pool) for the afternoon.,5
348,"I have been there now on 2 occasions with relatives for evening tea.  There is a wide range of offerings available from vegetarian (which are few) to sea food and meats.  I think the better option is to check with the waiter (as they are  font of knowledge regarding the local cuisine).  They serve 'on the house' biscuits or chips depending on the time. When you order food there is always extras as sides.  The main drawback is the time taken for food preparation.  If you are in a hurry check how long it takes to be served. Same with payment.  Otherwise, staff are friendly courteous and helpful",4
349,"Definitely a landmark in Sri Lanka.  Very nice historic hotel , rooms are ok and the welcome was nice ( cold drink and towel). The restaurant buffet is good.   Although communication with waiters is still a big issue here because of the bad knowledge of English.   The pool is well maintained but the pool boy needs a quick course in how to handle ladies who are alone at the pool.  In our country they receive the same respect as men.  ",4
350,"Great hotel, colonial style but modernised in respect with the past. very friendly and helpful staff, a very warm welcome with all the explanations .  One advice, one must try the spa... the massage service is at an very high level... perfect after a long journey ... ",5
351,"We stayed here for our first night of our Sri Lanka tour, with 3 kids. Lovely iconic hotel with great service. Pool a welcome place for a few beers after a long flight. Excellent breakfast, and really impressive rooms. ",5
352,"We only stayed at Galle Face for one night. We reached the hotel very early in the morning and were so tired but the check-in time was after 12. They were super quick at getting our room ready earlier and within half an hour gave us the keys to our room (more than 3 hours before actual check in).,The staff were very helpful and always had a smile on their face. Last but not least the breakfast was amazing. So much variety that suits all diet types. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay.",5
353,"This hotel was amazing. Located right next to the sea, the views from the rooms and around the hotel were beautiful. Inside, the colonial hotel was exquisite, with intricate decor and every detail thought out. It was very big - and it even had it's own museum which we were kindly given a tour around. although we only stayed there for one night, the dinner and breakfast buffets were delicious. Additionally, it's central location in Colombo is very handy.",4
354,"We loved the Galle Face Hotel and our only 'complaint' was that as it was the last night of our holiday, we didn't get the most out of the hotel. It is one of the most historic buildings in Colombo and has a real history, with many famous previous guests - it even has its own museum! ,The style internally is all colonial - and you get a real feel of being in an old world. It clearly is very popular and was very busy - and looked as though weddings/conferences took place frequently here.,It right on the sea front and next to the Galle Face Green, which comes alive at night with numerous street food vendors selling good quality, cheap food.,The hotel has a lovely bar & open-covered dining room, a further bar near the sea and a pool - such a shame we couldn't experience them.,The one huge downside is that all around there are massive, tall, modern buildings that literally dwarf the Galle Face - which is such a shame.",4
355,"This is a lovely British colonial hotel from 1864, overlooking the sea. Overall itâs beautiful, but it does feel a bit tired and dated in some areas of the hotel that hasnât yet been renovated. ,Recommend to stay in the comfortable newly renovated rooms as the non renovated rooms although spacious are quite old from the 1970s and therefore a bit dated! We asked for a room change and it was worth it! Issue is that only the double rooms have been renovated (not the twin rooms) and walls are thin but it wasnât a problem for us.,The minibar is complementary and the wifi works well. Service was very good overall, staff are friendly and very keen to help. ,A la carte food is very good (we didnât try the buffet) and breakfast was superb, both located at a terrace overlooking the sea! Gym is reasonably sized, and the swimming pool is spacious with sea view! ,Overall it was a lovely stay but hotel does need a bit of renovating in some areas!",4
356,In a beautiful old city thereâs a charming old colonial hotel. And in that old charming hotel thereâs a cosy little Travellerâs bar. And in that cosy little bar thereâs a terrace with a scenic sea view. And on that scenic terrace you can order the most wonderfully fresh veggie samosas and a drink of your choice. You wonât regret it. Enjoy!,4
357,"We stayed here on the last night of our honeymoon. We had high expectations and  were delighted when we were upgraded to a suite. Unfortunately it all went downhill from there. There was a lot of hair on the floor and in the shower in the bathroom and toilet. We were aiming to have an early night because we were flying home the next morning. This was impossible as there was a function being held below us and the music was so loud that the floor was shaking. We could not believe that a hotel would allow music to be played at this volume when they clearly have guests who want to sleep. We found the overall service to be quite average.,It is a very beautiful hotel and the location on the water is amazing. Perhaps we were unlucky that we stayed the same night as a function. We certainly wouldnât return.",4
358,"We spent two nights at this fabulous hotel in a suite. Wonderful spacious room. Very welcoming staff. Great outdoor salt water pool overlooking the ocean. ,We ate breakfast at hotel restaurant and it was divine. Fantastic mix of western & Sri Lankan food. ,Only disappointment was cocktails at outdoor bar near pool...my daiquiri was watery but other than that we loved our stay & highly reccomend.",5
359,A fantastic Hotel! A great group of welcoming staff that cannot do enough for you. Nothing is too much trouble. Fantastic history and a very wide choice of bars and restaurants. A great base to tour Colombo from.,4
360,"Located on the beach at Galle Face, this hotel is a step back in time to the colonial era.  Located on the beach, the hotel has a spectacular outlook to the Indian Ocean.,The beach/park to the right of the hotel is a mix of markets, with locals spending time with their families on the weekend flying kites - which looks amazing.,Rooms are well appointed and staff super friendly.  We used the expeditions service to book cars to take us to Kandy and Galle.  Well worth it and surprisingly not that expensive.,Food is outstanding, a mix of local and western cuisine for those who arenât so adventurous.  ,Good location for couples or families",5
361,"An incredible experience in this historical, elegant, beautiful building from the friendly staff to the elegance of your accommodation.  If you want to treat yourself in Colombo then this is the place to go.  The friendly staff are welcoming from the moment you arrive by the smiles on their faces and the warm wishes for a happy visit. Emanuel, the concierge, was an exceptional, knowledgeable gentleman who gave you his time to answer your questions and advise you on where to go in Colombo and places of interest. His happy personality reflects the pleasure and pride he takes in his job of assisting his clients.  The smiling, friendly staff we saw each morning at breakfast started our day with happiness. The array of delicious Sri Lanka food as well as international is superb. It was a pleasure to talk to Sisira, the matrede, and compliment him on the quality of his staff in the restaurant. Our room was elegant and all amenities were provided along with a selection of drinks and snacks in the fridge. The bed was very comfortable and with a fluffy doona that made is very cozy.  The salt water pool with the view of the ocean made a relaxing way to spend the afternoon. We wish to thank all the staff who made our visit so memorable and we look forward to returning to the Galle Face Hotel in the near future.",5
362,"This historical hotel, built in 1864 and recently restored.  Hotel is situated in the heart of Colombo, along the seafront and facing the famous Galle Face Green. We didn't stay at hotel but we watched Anthony Bourdain's TV Show ""Parts Unknown"" and we saw this hotel in this programme that's why we were very curious.We took a lunch in seafront cafe. Amazing view, very polite service and delicious food. If we go to Sri Lanka again, we want to stay a couple of day at Gallae Face Hotel.",4
363,"On our final night in Colombo we enjoyed our stay at this famous hotel situated right on shores of  the Indian Ocean . Service by the very professional staff was excellent and a feature was the comprehensive breakfast which caters for all tastes  . A swim in the salt water pool is a must along with a drink in the  ocean side bar .Rooms are very  comfortable and spacious and reflect traditions  of  past . It dates back to 1864 and has hosted many famous guests,from royalty to film stars .",4
364,We enjoyed a high tea here and then watched the sun set over the ocean. There is a nice atmosphere in the dining area and the high tea was good quality and plentiful. The service however was a little disappointing and does not compare to other hotels and restaurants we have been to in Sri Lanka.,4
365,"Excellent location right on the Indian Ocean, with the garden extending to the sea front. The hotel was renovated few years ago and they've kept the colonial era spirit alive in the interior decor (wood is very prominent in the walkways, room floors, bars). Rooms are large and comfortable. Bathrooms have separate shower and tub areas.  Breakfast spread is vast with various cuisines available. Staff is attentive and always smiling. Interestingly, there are squirrels and crows in the garden in front of the breakfast area ready to grab food from your plate if you are not attentive. Two staff are dedicated on the lawns with slingshots and laser pens to keep an eye on them to shoo them away. I found this very interesting.  ,The business district is not very far, and so are the shopping and dining areas (such as Odel and Dutch Hospital areas).  ,Definitely worth the stay at least once on your trips to Colombo.",4
366,"Although service was very slow. The waiter brought everyone a free iced coffee which was delicious.,There was too much food for two of us to finish.,They served tea with cold milk which was a nice change from most other places in Colombo.",4
367,"We started our journey to Sri Lanka here and it was the perfect base in the busy city of Colombo. The hotel is very well kept and lets you feel the charme of the colonial time. Donât expect the cold modern furniture as in recently build luxury hotels, but the perfect well kept interior of the colonial times. The garden and big terrace are facing to the see as well as the approx. 25m Pool.,Enjoying the incredibly rich breakfast buffet on the terrace is overwhelming.,The staff is quick, attentive and friendly.,Definetely anstrong recomendation.",4
368,"We loved to stay in Galle Face Hotel and Colombo. Where many travellers pass the city, we loved it. Upcomming, different neighborhoods and super heritage hotel. ,We loved especially the salt water swimming pool!",4
369,"This elegant hotel is a step back in time.  Rooms well appointed and comfortable . Lots of places to sit and soak up the atmosphere.  Buffet is plentiful and tasty. Pool area is great with a bar close by. The history room is fascinating and well worth a visit. The Galle face has history in every cranny,  with photographs and paintings taking you write thru its timeline.,Have enjoyed my stay. The staff are helpful and friendly.",5
370,"We stayed at this hotel upon our arrival in Colombo and checked in late at night. Although we were upgraded to sea view rooms, we found the bed sheets and towels to be not so clean although the breakfast spread was satisfactory. Also the collection of bags on our departure was slow.",3
371,"Nice hotel but not as grand as expected from all the write ups. Offered airport pick up for around $60aud which was fantastic. Check in was quick - great given 0130am! We booked a âlandmarkâ room which was clean but disappointing, small window that looked out on a boarded up turret âabsolutely nothing to see hereâ!! Pillows lovely and soft, bed ok, I judge hotels by their towels Iâm afraid and they were awful, clean but rough and completely unluxurious. Complimentary mini bar with some local soft drinks and snacks. Bottled water provided. Attentive staff. Buffet breakfast was good with range of options. Bar for drinks and coffee expensive but on par with what youâd expect for this type of hotel. Didnât try out the pool but it looked ok with sun loungers available,  overlooks ocean but too rough to swim. Whilst lovely antique furniture around decor feels a bit tired and huge rugs around were dirty. Taxis and tuk Tukâs available outside so easy to get around. ,Overall lovely, attentive staff, great historical aura but feels a little tired, if we come back to Colombo would try somewhere else.",3
372,"I just enjoyed a meal and a drink at the pool bar in the hotel and my experience was improved by 100% by Asanka, he made sure the service was great and we were all well and our meal and makin sure it was good and he made amazing cocktails and was happy to deal with our specific orders and make us extra special cocktails when we asked. I am yet to find a flaw in his work it was fabulous.",4
373,"Old somewhat stuffy property that you hope gets an update soon as the last refurbishment was done by someone stuck in the 90âs... the outside looks charming interior is rather dated.,Came for food around 11:00 and found the breakfast buffet already closed and lunch not starting until 12:30...,Opted for something from the pool bar and was quickly surrounded by three crows and 5 squirrels, all eight of them very ambitious, which made eating and drinking very uncomfortable and an unpleasant experience as these animals go onto your table and steal stuff. ,I complained to the associates but they seemed to not care, underlined only by seeing how one waiter dropped food as he was buzzing the table and was also feeding the squirrels from his hands...,I appreciate wildlife in all shapes and forms but encouraging these creatures to come to your property by doing things like this isnât really acceptable.,Food was good, so was the mocktails: service a little slow, which seemed the norm in Sri Lanka.",4
374,"Looking for a little piece of Old England and how things (I imagine) use to be, then this is the hotel for you. Yes it's old and yes it could do with an upgrade but I have no complaints what so ever. With it being old- the rooms are spacious, there are not 50 rooms on one floor with doors right next to each other, you have space and with space comes privacy. So you weigh up what's important for you and your stay. The breakfast was magnificent and I mean magnificent and the 1864 restaurant was superb with a fantastic array of culinary delights. The staff are probably the friendliest staff you could ever wish to meet. Really went out of their way to ensure your stay was most enjoyable. An absolute joy to ha e stayed there. Very like the Raffles in Singapore. Would I stay there again- for sure I would. ",5
375,"This charming old-style hotel is perhaps not for the glass and glitter set, but we loved the elegant authenticity that is missing in the bland hotel chains. Staff were friendly and helpful, our room was lovely with a balcony overlooking the ocean and amenities were first class.,Salt water pool and lounges overlooking the ocean, good curry dinner and nice breakfast. ,We were there on a Saturday night so walked along the waterfront of Galle Green watching hundreds of locals flying kites and enjoying their dinner next to the sea. ,A fabulous location - great for sleeping with the door/window open to hear the sea. A room with a balcony overlooking the sea is a plus.",5
376,"We stayed for several nights, and had an enjoyable time. The staff was friendly and helpful, and we loved every opportunity we had to talk with them. We used room service, the traveller's bar, and the buffet numerous times, and enjoyed them greatly. I responded poorly to something I ate at High Tea, but that could have been an allergy. A notes that is not apparent from the pictures and website: There really is not much of a beach. The hotel has a 70-100' stretch of shore, and we found seaglass, shells, and lots of crabs to watch, but that is all there is. Anywhere. The rest of the shore is developed overlooks. The only two issues we really had were 1.) Our room had a faint odor of sewer on check-in that continued getting stronger. On the third day, I finally traced it to a dry trap in a floor drain under the bathroom sink. We fixed it, and had no further issues. It was a small annoyance, and honestly, would probably been handled by the staff, except we generally do not like getting our room cleaned on a daily basis. 2.) The walls are thin. No big issue, and nothing the hotel can really do about it. Just be aware, and hope the neighbors aren't partiers. Overall a very nice stay, and a beautiful spot to savor the coast of the Indian Ocean.",4
377,"Expensive but worth every penny. We arrived 2am and slept through and missed breakfast. They apologised! And the breakfast is a sensational buffet, like at Raffles in Singapore. There were weddings, special events in the evenings, immaculate service, spotless rooms... the only complaint - and I am really trying hard to find something - would be a shortage of couches by the pool on a hot afternoon!!",5
378,We had the most wonderful time in this most exceptional hotel. The attention to detail was first class and we were treated like we were the most important guests they had staying. From the welcome drink to being allowed to use the pool despite a late flight we loved staying here. ,5
379,Great foot great service not five star since there was a small incident with our order they forgot one of the dishes but they fixed and provide free drinks to compensate.  Somenthimg they must improveI guess they should have more lights in the out doors table close to the flag stairs. But overall I am going back to eat. ,4
380,"It's like going back in time in this fabulous hotel, you can really feel the colonial history. Some of the rooms are a little small compared to others but we can recommend 1005 and 1006...very spacious. Or try and get a room that gives you access to the Long Room and enjoy comp sundowners and snacks. Lovely pool area where you can listen to the crashing waves below. Spa excellent, one of the best massages I've ever had! Breakfast buffet was also good...and there's always a wedding on for perfect people watching opportunities!",5
381,"I last visited 20 years ago and the feel of the Place hasnât changed much. You feel rather privileged to be welcomed and allowed to stay.  Attentive staff (appropriately not over friendly), very clean, good food, stunning location. Kids loved it. Looking forward to returning in less than 20 years time",5
382,"Stayed here with family. After a painful check in we were shown an upgraded room. The floors were shaking with the noise from a wedding down stairs.  We were eventually taken to our superior deluxe which turned out to be a gloomy little room with no view, paper thin walls and a baby crying next door.  This hotel is overpriced with taxes that increase every bill by a third. The terrace was lovely though and I suggest you visit for a cocktail in the evening and stay somewhere nicer.",2
383,"We chose this hotel based on pictures we found, the colonial really appealed to us. When we got there we  were a little bit worried since the hotel is located near the city center where a lot of sites are now under construction, however there's nothing to worry about (some) rooms and breakfast terrace are facing the sea and since the hotel is U shaped when you stay inside you really get the feeling that you are somewhere calm  far away from the city. The rooms were clean & well designed (the lamps <3 <3 <3).  The downside were the 1) size of the room , it was really small in comparison to other hotels ranging in the same price category and 2) the minibar, there was water and two local sodas (and few snacks) - I know it's tacky but one - just one - can of pepsi/cola would have been so nice to have, especially after the long trip. I known that the hotel makes the minibar free of charge so I shouldn't expect too much, but at some point, it's more about the content then the price. I had the fanta-like ginger soda and it was disappointing. The upside was definitely the breakfast, design & view! The choice of different pastries,fruits, juices, eggs and curry was really good! The passion fruit ice tea was delicious & refreshing!",4
384,"How special to stay here: right on the beach, in an such an elegant and historic building. Beautiful rooms (the suite at the front was spacious and grand), fabulous spa (loved the massage), delicious buffet and bar beachside. An absolute must to get a feel for old Colombo - there is even a museum in it, with artefacts & photographs of famous guests. Loved it. Thankyou",4
385,"Stayed her for 3 nights in July 2018. Excellent place, great location, clean private access to beach (though quite a tiny stretch). Excellent bar facilities and buffet, breakfast and dinner. Junior suite with sea views was highlight of the stay with free access to the long room with fab views of the sunset in the evenings with complementary drinks and canapÃ©s. ,Staff go out of the way to help out. ,Have to single out doorman Dilum who ensured we were looked after in the business centre when we were in urgent need of access to internet, printer etc, way out of usual business hours. ,Mohammed (I think, originally from southIndia) in the buffet area, attentive and excellent at his ""appam"" skills,smooth check in and check out. ,overall great experience, and would certainly stay again.",5
386,"Great historical hotel, attentive staff, lovely, well serviced rooms. Much better than staying in a characterless, modern 5 star hotel, but the same great service. Salt water pool, good size but children did not like all the rules!!",5
387,"Grand hotel in a fantastic location in Colombo , right on the waterfront and next to the Galle Face Green . ,We didnât have a smooth  start as our booking had not registered so there was a delay getting our room. Sometimes you learn more about standards and service when things donât go to plan , and they were outstanding in the way they handled it .,Great staff , buffet , wine and drinks list ,Highly recommended  ",4
388,Great hotel great service wonderful food In particular Wasantha Fernando did such great work to make my stay enjoyable such a friendly man. All around the staff were so friendly and kind. I think it is great that guests can walk across the road onto the iconic Galle face green,5
389,"An amazing property, full of history and culture. Most city hotels are all pretty much,The same, nice modern room, good amenities, concierge etc but Galle Face Hotel is unique. Every piece in the hotel has a story, down to the longest serving staff member of 53 years. I stayed in the Dutch royal suite and thereâs a great ocean view from the balcony, the room is spacious and there were a variety of fruits on the room when I arrived. I had 1 spa treatment and it was very good, my therapist was strong enough and managed to work away some aches. On the second floor of the hotel they have their own private museum with some interesting history and artefacts. I had a walk through the library, a nice space to sit quietly and read or even get some emails done. ",5
390,"I really liked this hotel.  Room was alright but the  history, staff , food and location all shine. It was the only hotel where we chose to eat in the hotel each night.   ,Six year old loved the pool and I enjoyed the sea views",4
391,"For a big hotel the staff are very attentive. The venue is obviously very busy with weddings and outside functions, but I felt the staff still made a solid effort to learn who the in house guests were and make sure we were enjoying our stay. Everyone was fantastic! ,We booked a balcony suite which overlooked the ocean and was gorgeous with high ceilings and cool air con. Breakfast buffet was included which was the same every day but still enjoyable and the evening canapÃ©s and complimentary drink hour for suite guests in the long room bar was fantastic. Itâs also a lovely touch that the mini bar in suites is complimentary. You really get your monies worth when you splurge here. ,The ocean is not safe for swimming because of the swell, but the pool is lovely and you get a great view of the sea from the sun lounges. ,We ate at all the restaurants here and enjoyed all of them. ,Highly recommended. ",5
392,"Really loved this hotel.  Exudes old world charm.  Really nice rooms which blend all the modern comforts you would expect from a 5 star hotel with the history of the hotel.  Fantastic breakfasts, with a choice of Sri Lankan or European. Loved the Travellers bar.  ",5
393,"Wonderful colonial style hotel on the beach at Colombo. Had a basic room, 3047 but it was more than adequate for a couple of days.  Breakfast is great, huge choice, staff are all lovely (shout out to Keeth who maintained our room).  Gym is very good size for a hotel, pool by the beach is nice, lots of places to relax and have a drink in the evening.  ,Very popular for weddings with generations of the same family getting married here. We were lucky enough to see a traditional gathering, one of the twenty this month apparently. ,Highly recommended if you prefer old style charm. ",4
394,"What a glorious hotel...... what an purely pleasurable experience. Galle Face delivers in abundance with attention to detail and faultless service.,We dined at 1874 which was excellent on all levels. I spent hours at the day spa in the hands of exceptional staff. Breakfasts were beautifully executed. I tried Curries like I have never tasted before. Swam in the pool daily and in the end was reluctant to leave. ,The decor is perfectly executed for the glorious building that it is. Sophisticated colour palates and seductive spaces make you not want to leave.,What a sensational start to our vacation in Sri Lanka - thank you to all the wonderful staff at Galle Face Hotel you do your business proud.",5
395,No hotel in Colombo can beat the charm of this hotel. It has a lot of history and the view from the restaurant is amazing. The rooms are a little old now but still well appointed and the restaurant serves top quality food. Worth a stay at least once if you're in Colombo!,4
396,Stayed here at the start of our trip to Sri Lanka. We had two junior suites and they were beautifully decorated with great ocean and pool views. Bathrooms were modern and functional. Quality of the towels was a little disappointing. We had access to the Long Room and really enjoyed pre dinner drinks and nibbles there. Breakfast was okay but not great. Good choice of food on offer but it felt a bit like a cafeteria. Very busy. Great views though.  The staff were helpful and the housekeeping guys were super. We used the hotel car one evening to go into town for supper. The driver had very poor English and got lost...taking 30 mins for a 10minute journey. We used Uber the second night.worked brilliantly and a quarter of the cost of the hotel car.,4
397,We had a office friends gathering at pool bar.. Place was Lovley and we had some fantastic drinks along with excellent bar bites.. Sunset makes a extra value for this great location.. Can recommend any one for simmilar events. ,5
398,"Just had a wonderful couple of days at this hotel. our room was in the old part. Quite small but full of charm. Rooms have been recently renovated so had traditional decor/ furniture but newly and freshly decorated. Have previously stayed in both parts of the hotel and this room was lovely. Nice bathroom too. Service was slick, food excellent and although you are based in central Colombo where itâs very very busy, we didnât feel it. It felt calm inside. Our room (Premier Ocean View room also included breakfast, a free minibar (soft drinks) and also club access to all beverages and hot food in the evenings. We had a huge balcony.  This is our third or fourth visit to this hotel and would really recommend. We also stayed at The Mount Lavinia hotel at the end of our tour and that was very âtiredâ in comparison.",5
399,"This is one of the oldest hotels in Colombo. How ever, parking could be quite a nightmare if you happen to go there when they have a reasonably big event in one of their halls. ,Worst part is that they stop valet parking once the parking slots I  the visinity are over. I have not seen this policy in any other hotel. ,The security staff is generally unhelpful and indifferent and borders on being rude.,The facilities, public toilets ECT are good though may not be called top of the range.,Next time when I have to go there I would take a taxi and I will definitely not tip the security staff.",1
400,"Located directly at the seaside you have the best view you can imagine. Great service and food and a historical building that just oozes from the British times. Very friendly, helpfull and smiling staff - want to go there again if possible - best recommandations ",4
401,"This review is only about the afternoon tea, not about the hotel. The afternoon tea was very good. From the veranda overlooking the ocean I enjoyed a luxurious tea. Since it was so hot outside they even brought me an ice coffee to start off with. The food of the afternoon tea was a nice mix of West and east. Price is very reasonable ",4
402,"Very Nice Hotel in Colombo, Open Bar and Restaurant also very nice , they have renovated this few months before , but i couldnt visit there after that. i have been there in several times.  Nice , Excellent ",4
403,Great location and beautiful hote. Staff very hospitable. Really took care of you. Very old school and that was really nice. Rooms facing on to the street at the back are very noisy and being an old hotel the sound proofing was low. Food is great but would be good to see more of the local fare rather than the international food options. ,4
404,"Best place I have ever stayed in Colombo. I have been traveling to Colombo for years. Usually stayed in  Hilton of Cinnamon Grande, as Galle Face was under reconstruction.,The refurbished Galle Face is beautiful. But personal service is excellent at all levels and appears 'sincere' in comparison with the other hotels I have experience of in Colombia. Not sycophantic, but humorous and very personable.,This is a really special hotel. Whilst not a Spa person, the upgraded amenities are the best I have experienced in many hotels.",5
405,"I stayed for a couple of days in a junior suite for a business trip. Staff are friendly and helpful.  Room was spacious even for the standards of a suite, neat and very clean. Bathroom was relaxing. Outdoor seating for lunch at Verandah restaurant is lovely. Hotel theme and style is historical and classy.  The business center, meeting rooms and conference halls and its adjacent catering areas are well equipped, luxurious and very stylish.  The beach is just across the road.  Reasonable driving time to the main shopping areas within 10 to 15 minutes. I definitely would like to stay there again",5
406,"If you want a hotel with character and old world charm, but one that still makes you feel like royalty, this is your place. We absolutely loved our stay here. The staff is amazing, smiles everywhere, the service is top-notch, and the food is superb. We had a buffet breakfast included during our week here, and we loved it. We also frequented the other restaurants and none of them disappointed. I would highly recommend this hotel for the service, the high standard for excellence, and the location. You can't beat an ocean view in the heart of all the city action!",5
407,Galle Face Hotel is a beautiful colonial hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful and the location for breakfast was divine. Pool setting cocktails at sunset were fabulous and interconnecting rooms great for the family.,5
408,"My favourite hotel in Colombo ! Raffles of Sri Lanka ! ,I have stayed here many times , recently noticed that price per night has gone up significantly !! To reflect this there has not been any improvement in the services ! Can get busy with weddings !! Unfortunately the coffee shop has been removed , it was a great place to relax with good quality Sri Lankan pastries!",3
409,"We had a great week here while attending our special jw.org convention, visiting from the US. The staff, food, view, spa, cleanliness, and service all made this a 5 star experience. Great attention to detail by the friendly staff.",5
410,"We booked the Galle Face hotel for the last night of our trip to Sri Lanka. We splashed out on a junior suite to make our last night special.,We were in fact upgraded to a bigger suite which was very nice. The hotel decor is delightful with lovely sea views. But...... the service was a let down. ,My husband and I were sharing the suite with our teenage son and requested an extra bed at time of booking. When we arrived we asked for the extra bed to be put in the room. It didnât arrive, so on our way out for a spot of shopping we asked again and were assured it would be delivered to the room whilst we were out. When we returned ..... still no bed.,We rang reception and asked for the third time, to be told it would be done whilst we were at dinner. On return from dinner, still no bed! In fact it took my husband going down to reception at 9.30pm and asking for the 5th time, as we wanted to get to bed early for our flight the next morning.,I have to say that the service we received throughout our trip was excellent. This was the one exception and a disappointing end to a lovely trip.",4
411,"Our family stayed here two nights at the start of our holiday. It was a refuge in a busy city. Staff were great, rooms fabulous, breakfast delicious. Pool side bar great, pool clean and a good size. Highly recommend as a luxurious treat.",5
412,"A big call but it has so much charm and I think has more to offer than some of the other old grand hotels. Staff fantastic including Keith Fernando who looked after my room needs so well. ,The food is amazing and occasionally I was entertained by a lavish wedding in front of the sea.",5
413,"We booked for three nights into this well known hotel at the start of a fortnight of travelling around Sri Lanka. However our expectations were soon dashed. All five people in our party came down with symptoms of food poisoning although none of us ate anywhere outside the hotel. One of our party ended up in hospital where she was diagnosed with Campylobacter. The remaining four of us were less badly affected but the incident ruined the start of our holiday. We were disappointed that the hotel not only took no responsibility, but showed no concern and offered no apology. Their attitude was arrogant and uncaring. Despite being highly experienced travellers we were all left shocked and dismayed and under no circumstances would recommend anyone to stay here. Iâm glad to say this bad experience was not repeated anywhere else in Sri Lanka but made a very unfortunate impression. The management of this hotel needs to try harder in every sense.",1
414,"Again a great place to finish our two week holiday ,First night there was a huge wedding which was great to watch,The hotel is amazing which you would expect, rooms very clean, service great,Lounged by the salt water pool, lots of happy hour drinks",4
415,"We have just spent a week at this Hotel. The Staff provided every help and assistance. The location is excellent to benefit from the sea-view and also proximity to the town centre. The Verandah Restaurant  provided an excellent Buffet for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.",4
416,"Had 2 nights here to acclimatise before setting of on tour. Itâs a great spot to relax if you need to get over a long flight or arrive late at night, also a good base for exploring Colombo.,The rooms are a bit dated but large and ,everything works fine. The real highlights are the excellent service from all staff, happy hour drinks on the terrace of the Travellers bar and the superb breakfast served on the veranda overlooking the ocean. Thereâs also a small museum worth checking out as befits a place with an interesting history and many notable former guests.,You canât swim in the sea here (Iâm not sure you can anywhere in Colombo as it seems quite polluted) but thereâs a nice saltwater pool which I actually found a nice change from the usual heavily chlorinated hotel pools. Thereâs also a gym which is small but ok for a holiday workout.,Didnât have dinner at the hotel as we went to the Ministry of Crab (which is a 5 minute tuktuk or car ride away) but the evening buffet on the lawn looked very popular.,Overall the place has real charm and would stay again if returning to Colombo",4
417,"If you enjoy some old style charm, similar to Raffles, Singapore stay here. We had a seaview room which was very large. The bed and bedding was very comfortable. The giant spa bath in the middle of the room novel, and the after 5's canapes excellent. Breakfast was delicious and the service flawless. Staying right next to Galle Face Green was a bonus, and a late afternoon walk down the promenade is certainly an experience worth having.",5
418,"I wanted to dine at continental restaurant ,since I had dined at the Capital bar  & Grill at the Shangri-La Colombo and experienced the food and service to be one of the best in Colombo , overall . ,The choice on offer on the menu was limited but the staff was willing to go that extra mile., ,Well Done 1864 !",4
419,"My family stayed overnight here on a half board basis. A wonderful historic hotel with real atmosphere. We used the pool area which was beautifully kept. The rooms were very traditional with ample space and bath and also a hugewa in shower. Fridge in room with complimentary bar.,The restaurant was beautifully situated over looking the sea and the food (buffet) was beautiful curry, salad, bread, soups, a good mixture. Breakfast again buffet style in the same restaurant was wonderful curry to omelett, all taste catered for. ,We highly recommend the Galle Face Hotel.",5
420,Nice place to stay over night.se view hotel and send faced bar is place to have a coffee in the evening.r oom was very clean and the staff was very helpful for us.and easy to booking and contact the hotel as well.,4
421,"This hotel has stunning grounds. Pool and restaurants face the ocean which makes for beautiful sunset and breakfast views. Staff at the restaurant for dinner her helpful and friendly and the breakfast buffet had some delicious choices. A downside would be a location, as there is not much around, for example, I had to walk for around 10 minutes to find a working ATM. However, Iâm not sure anywhere in Colombo would have an ideal location and they do have Tuk Tuks waiting outside. As for the rooms, the bathroom is beautiful and spacious but the actual room is slightly on the smaller side. Overall, a comfortable and pleasant stay.",4
422,"Two nights in Colombo staying at the Galle Face. A lovely old style hotel on the waterfront. A Colombo institution. Rooms were large and well equipped, staff friendly and attentive, would certainly recommend it. Ate in the beach bar one night and had drinks there the second. Food was good and reasonably priced for where you are, other restaurants in hotel weâre a bit more pricey and smarter but still good value. The pool was lovely and overall hotel facilities were first rate, remember this is an old colonial hotel and it feels like it. ,Colombo itself is a mad âIndianâcity with all the contrasts and challenges you would expect in this part of the world, the Dutch hospital is a wee oasis in the storm, lovely for a coffee and a sit down before hitting galleface green or slave island areas. Usual bunch of hangers on, just donât engage with them.",4
423,"Stayed for 6 days. Its heaven. What a place. Great food, amenities, service. Me and my wife really liked this place. ,One thing I want to recommend. It was my official tour. I took my wife with me but hotel charged for her breakfast. I was in Manila last year but in similar situation Hotel Sedan didnt charge anything for breakfast and I still remember their good gesture.,SHAZIB SAEED",5
424,"We started our trip with this hotel and must say it was the Best.We would have loved to stay longer at this hotel.The hotel is facing the sea and the restaurants too face the sea which makes it a wonderful setting for a meal.we enjoy the stay , food and service at this hotel.Would love to come back.",5
425,"We have just spent three days at this wonderfully old hotel. It is just as good on the interior as the exterior. With its position on the coast and itâs history, it truly was a unique place to stay. The breakfast buffet was lovely but we did not eat any other meals in the hotel. The lounge areas - inside and out, are fabulous for drinks. ,The staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble.",4
426,"Words almost don't do this place justice. It's a total throwback, from the architecture to the ambiance to the accommodation. Hotel staff is just itching to satisfy -- no request is too audacious and the many employees working the grounds seemed to take pride in their work and the satisfaction of the guests. ,The room was spectacular. It was large and airy with a small balcony that overlooked the Indian Ocean. A large hot tub sat almost in the middle of the room, separating the entry area from the bath/shower area. Lots of fine stone and marble. The bed was fit for a Sinhalese monarch. The shower was fully enclosed and steamed up like a closed pot full of broccoli. ,The hotel itself was like a living museum. I could spend a day or so just wandering its halls and exploring the grounds. ,This place was one of several my wife and I stayed at during our honeymoon in Sri Lanka, and it ranked among the highlights of the trip.",4
427,"We loved Galle Face, an amazing old hotel with a rich history and beautiful rooms. The Travellerâs Bar makes great cocktails and the view of the ocean from the bar is stunning. Brilliantly helpful staff and very centrally located, though not noisy in the rooms at all. The only negative would be that the breakfast is a little pricey, but if you wanted to fill up on the entire buffet then you could definitely get your moneyâs worth! ,Situated right by the main beach, you can walk out the front door and start experiencing the hustle and bustle of Colombo right away.",4
428,"Our 4th stay at this iconic hotel as a family of 4 adults occupying 2 junior suites impressively and attentively serviced by âKeeth,â for whom nothing was too much trouble.,The selection and quality of the Sri Lankan cuisine has delighted us on every visit and even more so on this occasion. The local cuisine is admirably complemented by a rotation of other international cuisines. Once again, the service of staff throughout the hotel, from doormen through to porters and wait staff in the dining room, at the pool bar and the verandah bar, has been charming and attentive.,Definitely a place to return to, to restore and revive through its exemplary hospitality.",5
429,"The hotel is nice, very luxurious.,But the standard double room is just ok. You can hear every word from the next room, the bathroom is ok.,The price is not really reasonable for nothing is included (not even breakfast -15$),The service is grest of course but all in all would not come again.",3
430,"The hotel is good but old.,The renovation is only on public areas not in the rooms.,My room had a not nice smell of wet wood and lots and lots of ants!,Staff is very friendly, breakfast in open air very charming.",5
431,"This was the best decision too stay for a few days & be introduced to the delights of Sri Lanka. This hotel carries so much history, it is the oldest hotel in Sri Lanka, has its own museum and gallery of photos of notable people who have visited over the yearsl, I highly recommend you treat yourself & stay here if you can or at least visit the museum and stay for high tea.",5
432,"A beautiful hotel with the best fish restaurant ever and amazing service.,I only got to stay for 2 nights but the highlights were the salt water pool, the breakfast view of the sea and the great fish restaurant",4
433,We family of 4 stayed in Junior Suites at Galle Face Hotel. It still has the colonial welcoming of its guest. Heights of our stay was watching lowering of the national flag at sunset with a Scottish piper tune.,4
434,"We only stayed for one night giving us some time to explore Colombo after touring round Sri Lanka.  Wow what a beautiful hotel.  The staff at recpetion were very efficient and we were escorted to our room.  It is a very large rambling hotel and it took us a few attempts to find our way round, inlcudng finding the museum which had some intertesting details about the hotel and previous famous guests.,Our superior room was very classical in design and felt very colional and was of a very high standard.  There were complemntary items in the minibar whihc as such a lovely touch with tea and coffee facilities.  As we were there for poya (full moon) no alcohol as being served but this did not bother us or appear to imping on the overall atmosphere around the pool bar were we spent some time looking out to sea.  Breakfast was served at the verandah whihc was buffet style and had a good choice.  We had the buffet at the verandah for our evening meal which had a good selection.,Whilst we were there there were weddings going up but this did not impact on our stay at all.  ,Overall it's a throughly charming hotel with polite and courteous staff.",5
435,Nothing special except for their breakfast. Great breakfast and do spend time on their poolside bar. Nice sea to watch and relax while you sip your drink. Seafood restaurant was really good. Very fresh and very good service.,4
436,Thanks to management and staff for all your help and support for our recent workshop. We spent a week in the hotel and had a successful meeting.  I would like to specifically mention Fernando - Room Attendant - who helped out while I was working in my room.,5
437,"Built in 1864, this grand hotel kisses the Indian Ocean. While retaining the regal elegance of the past, it offers top end modern amenities. One is always near the sea, with sound of waves audible throughout the day. This is a beach resort that has few parallels in the world. Hospitality is excellent, the rooms are comfortable and food is superb. Some of the latches on the doors and windows, however, could do with better maintainance.",4
438,"I am currently in the hotel with my wife. My company made the booking for me for 10 nights. We were both welcomed on arrival shown the hotel and told our booking included breakfast and complimentary dinner in the buffet resteraunt. On the second day we decided to go for the dinner at the end of which we were given a bill for one person. I questioned this and was told that the room was only for one person, my wife!!!!!. I questioned this with reception who confirmed this. I tried to sort this out and they said please come tomorrow and we will sort it. I went the next day and they still couldn't help me so we decided not to use the restraunt as the food was less than average anyway. Finally a day later we received a letter at the room asking us to go to reception. I went to reception and spent a great deal of time trying to sort this out and change the rate etc. The reception confirmed they would keep the same rate but acknowledge 2 persons in the room and I advised we would not use the complementary dinner. All sorted you would think. 2 days later (today) I was asked to leave the pool as my wife was already there and our room booking was for one. We will now check out early and go to a different hotel.",1
439,"Perfect place to watch the sunset and the daily ceremony with bagpipes to lower the National flag. This colonial hotel is refurbished and looks lovely with quite a few restaurant options to dine from.,But the last couple of times We visited the customer service hasnât been great, which needs to be addressed immediately. ",5
440,"I found that the attitude of the F&B staff (partricularly in the Long Room and the Breakfast Verandah) was appaling as they were only interersted to smile and serve western or Japanese guests. Asians were ignored and often given a rude look. The rooms are very small and if you have a roll away bed there is hardly any space to move. Room with a balcony but it seemed like they never cleaned the balcony chairs . They do not allow TukTuk to drop you at the entrance porch even if you have luggage or purchases, rain or shine. If you are dropped off by TukTuk they don't bother to help you with luggage. So with the distance from the gate, rain and inconvenience you need to manage your luggage or purchases as well. Overall I consider that this hotel is still living in the era of Colonialism and unless you are one in line with colonial thinking you may be put off. F&B was not great with very limited options for vegetarians or vegans. They don't change menus as well.",2
441,It's my first time at the majestic hotel although I live in the beautiful island. I am at the hotel on work but got the chance to relax at the pool bar and it was great. Luxury blended in with the colonial touch and would recommend to anyone. ,5
442,"The Galle Face is a beautiful Colonial Stile Hotel facing the Indian Ocean. Itâs a Hotel since 1864 but the building is much older and has a lot of history! If you like this type of hotels like the Raffles in Singapore or the Eastern&Oreintal in Penang, then you will love it.,There are all amenities like big outdoor swimming pool, SPA and Gym. There are two separate bars and three restaurants. We tested the 1864 one night and it was pretty good. The breakfast is served in a big open veranda, with lots of choice from Continental over America and local Curries. The staff is friendly and in particular the in-house travel Specialist was very helpful. You can book and tailor made all your trips to Kandy and other highlights of the island to your liking.",5
443,"We stayed for one night after arriving in Colombo.  We were welcomed with a refreshing drink and sweets, check in was quick and efficient.  We booked two rooms and were given an upgrade on one, which was huge with a Jacuzzi bath, although the room was a little dark without a view.  I can imagine the rooms overlooking the sea have magnificent views.  The hotel still maintains a traditional colonial feel and it was areal pleasure to treat ourselves to a stay here.  The staff, views over the ocean and food were all excellent.   ",5
444,"Great breakfast. Room is a bit old and needs upgrade! However, the sea view is fantastic.,Sitting next to the beach and having a drink by the pool is truly enjoyable. Do need to book in advance, can be expensive.",4
445,"This was our final night in Sri Lanka before our long flight home.  At first glance the hotel was awe-inspiring, but the staff could not have been more welcoming or helpful.  Our upgraded room was beautiful, with fabulous views from two sides.  The room certainly met our every need.  We had initially planned to eat elsewhere, but having been shown the restaurants we decided to eat at the hotel.  The food was good and the staff attentive so we were pleased with our decision.  Many thanks for the anniversary cake.",5
446,"The breakfast buffet is absolutely the same stuff 7 days a week. Just to let you have an idea about it: Srilankan cuisine consist indeed daily of Chicken, Dhaal and Egg curry. Nothing else! There's no other option to chose. No other sort of vegetable or meat for a change.,Similar with the English cuisine.,The restaurant staff is mixed from friendly to quite unfriendly waiters who simply have no fun working in the field of service.,Food is not prepared in a hygienic way, daily stomach ache after eating from the breakfast buffet. This didn't happen at any other place in Colombo before.,Housekeeping staff is absolutely lazy, the cleanliness is a disaster, used towels of previous guests are kept to be dried and then kept back for new guests arriving. If we request house keeping as soon as possible in order to enjoy our spare time afterwards or to take a nap, we have to wait over 3 hours untill the house keeping arrives. The complimentary minibar is not refilled properly. Especially snacks are not being refilled at all, the staff keep the snacks for themselves putting the items to the guest's bill. ,Location is quite nice. Front desk simply friendly.",3
447,Four of us had a latish breakfast on the veranda of this wonderful hotel . It is one of the very best hotels in Asia and has been refurbished carefully in recent times . The veranda is perhaps the best place of all to sit and have breakfast in Colombo - a wonderful venue overlooking the sea with waves crashing in and black crows circling to see if they can steal a bite .,5
448,The breakfast spread is splendid and sure business and leisure travelers like it. Best thing about this hotel is that itâs located overlooking the sea giving a beautiful view from the room and Colonial architecture in wonderful setting. Relaxing and fully of charme! House keeping staff were friendly and accommodating also. Overall I was very impressed and I would definitely stay here again.,5
449,"This is a very cool hotel with a lot of history. If you want something that is authentic to Sri Lanka instead of the standard international hotels nearby, this is a great choice. It was also a reasonable distance from the airport. Maybe 45 minutes. My friends and I stayed here for one night when we flew into Colombo before traveling to another location. This is a huge hotel, so make sure that you get rooms in the new wing because they have an old wing where the rooms are not as good. Also, the rooms that are much closer to the water can be very damp. Our room was facing the hotel's front entrance and was great. There were 3 of us and the hotel was great about getting us a third small bed added to the room. My favorite part about the room was the bathroom. Great facilities and great tub. Everything was very spacious. The beds were very comfortable. But the reason to go here is the breakfast. Best breakfast ever. They have so many great Sri Lankan dishes to try and all of it is great. The staff in the restaurant and everywhere else are so friendly and helpful. They set a high standard for Sri Lankan hospitality. It was a great first impression when visiting this country for the first time.",4
450,Received warm welcome and extremely courteous service from staff across all grades. The always smiling staff could not have been more helpful. Look forward to returning to this historic hotel with its unrivalled ocean views and very comfortable accommodation. ,5
451,Awesome ambience with a breathtaking sea view.The buffet and a la care are exceptionally delicious.The spread is exciting with a good mix of authentic Sri Lankan food and continental dishes.Don't miss a walk along the sea face of this restaurant sipping a glass of wine.,4
452,"We had a lovely few days at this hotel and loved the quiet elegance in a noisy chaotic city. Staff were great. Sujith took us down to the museum and gave us a tour including the ballroom too.  We hired a driver, Ayan, who calmly drove us around the chaotic city dropping us wherever we wanted to look.,Food and service in the verandah restaurant was excellent.",4
453,"We have stayed at the Galle Face on a number of occasions over many years. It has continued to improve with ongoing renovations being completed. Great food and service. We love the verandah restaurant especially the breakfasts with hoppers, egg hoppers, papaya juice and the rest. And the fellow with the sling shot who is always there to ward off the myna birds. Rooms great too with views over the ",5
454,"We arrived about 1 am and were installed in a room with a very noisy air conditioner and no lights in the bathrooms, so not impressed at that time of the night!  However a call to reception soon had us relocated for a good night's sleep in a very comfortable bed.  Breakfast on the terrace overlooking the lawn and beach next morning was excellent.  The hotel is very centrally located and we had 3 nights there enjoying the efficiency of the very pleasant staff.  Would definitely return if visiting Colombo again.",4
455,"We spent two nights at the Galle Face Hotel. ,Room and bathroom were perfect (really worth 5 stars). Superb buffet breakfast. Swimming pool close to the sea. Bar and restaurant overlooking the beach (less than 50 meters away) - kind of a hideway from the busy town.,Staff was helpful and responsive. Special mention to the concierge !,PS: do not forget to visit the small museum",4
456,"Couldn't fault a thing at this hotel...service, food, accommodation all tops..,I would recommend this hotel above all other NEW hotels that have sprung up in Colombo City.,Proximity to all other spots all within walking distance.",4
457,"Nice Colonial Style City Hotel in Colombo.,Comfortable, Clean Ocean View Rooms, Very Good Breakfast Buffet with a rage of Asian Food.,Nice Veranda and a Open Bar area. Friendly Staff willingly to help at all requests.",4
458,"A lovely hotel with great staff. Itâs old and a tad jaded but in the middle of refurb. Had drinks on the balcony and got moved so they could work on the fan - unique experience watching the ocean, cocktail in hand with a ladder to your right. At dusk they go collect the flag from the beach, with bagpipes. A romantic notion but when the rain is coming in sideways and the sea has 5ft waves I felt a tad sorry for the pair. The inside bar was closed, I later learnt as the Prime minister was hosting....so you know you have chosen the right location :)  ,Rooms roomy but was freezing, had the AC on low but still chilly. Bed comfortable and large bathroom. ",4
459,"Simply the best hotel with nice views  by the beach and close to shops and restaurants. Good food at the hotel , nice and comfortable room, friendly staff with excellent customer focused service. There is a huge public ground facing the beach called Gale face it become live in the night with full of activities , lot of local eateries at night in the ground, best place to see the sight and sound of Colombo.",4
460,"We were warmly greeted upon arrival and told we would be getting a free upgrade to a premium ocean view room, which was fantastic. To come back from the pool to a bottle of sparkling wine, fruit basket and a cake was another great surprise! ,The use of the long room with its free happy hour and breakfast the next morning was unexpected and much appreciated.,The staff are all very professional and unlike many other places we stayed during our two weeks in Sri Lanka, are obviously well used to dealing with Western tourists and how to treat them professionally. Anything we needed was dealt with swiftly and without a fuss.,The furniture in the hotel is beautiful and the decor and comfort of the room itself was 5*. The swimming pool was great for swimming in and actually deep, unlike a lot of other hotel pools.,When we return to Colombo we will without a doubt be staying at the Galle Face hotel (hopefully for longer!)",5
461,"The only hotel on the edge of the Ocean in Colombo. Apart from the fact that we for some reason got a room that had very little area around the beds... our stay was absolutely great!,The hotel by itself is iconic and there is a an Old world charm and poise to it. The staff are incredibly helpful and cheerful. Spotlessly clean hotel despite the amount of activity that happens.Food is pretty good and service is excellent. It is also at a really good location to get around Colombo.,One must spend time at the sea side restaurant/bar to make the experience complete.",5
462,On the very edge of the ocean. The closest to the sea out of all the hotels in colombo. Can't beat the view. Nice service. Good food. Since its renovations the quality has become better. The court yard is an amazing place to be ehen the sun is setting. ,4
463,"The setting, by the beach with the roar of eaves crashing, colonial era architecture and fittings reminiscent of fabled hotels such as Singapore's Raffles, right down to the lift which moved at a glacial pace - all made for a charming experience.,The staff were also friendly and helpful. ,Would return.",4
464,"Built in 1864 the Galle Face Hotel is wonderfully preserved with old world luxury and charm. Drinks on the terrace facing the Indian ocean, a delightful buffet restaurant again with ocean views, peerless service from an abundance of staff, replete with all kinds of private rooms and nooks and crannies to explore the Hotel makes the past become the present again. It's only drawback is that it is so hard to leave it and experience the many wonderful sights of Colombo! The list of previous customers includes Sting, Liz Taylor, Vivian Leigh and even Che Guevara! Like being part of an Agatha Christie novel.Not to be missed! Highly recommended.",5
465,Spent two nights at this charming hotel. Location is great. Itâs what one would expect in an old colonial hotel. What I liked most is the pool area. Watching and listening to the waves crashing is very mesmerizing.... ,4
466,"As a tradition in our family we take our mothers out for a meal on Motherâs Day. So this year we decided to take them to Galle Face hotelâs high tea as the view there is very soothing. ,First we got there by 4pm as high tea begins at that time. But to our surprise food arrived around almost 5pm (keeping in mind that high tea finishes at 6). This was after several reminders. ,We were taken by surprise when we saw the food. There was hardly any good food. About two varieties of sandwiches, a bun and a pastry some scones and very tiny piece of cake. We were given ice coffee and hot tea and coffee. ,The food tasted horrible! The sandwiches were so bad! The entire Motherâs Day plan was ruined. We expected a better platter. Non of us were happy after spending about Rs.18,400/- for 8 of us. On top of that the service was terrible. There were hardly any stewards/servers! Every time we wanted something I had to rush to the reception area of the Verandha restaurant. ",3
467,"We just loved this place! Room, services, food are just amazing.,The break-fast buffet is one of the best we had in Sri Lanka with lot of choice and really nice juices (specially the king coconut juice).,Thank you for this relaxing and really good time.",5
468,"We were quite looking forward to staying at Galle Face for our last night in SL after reading some good reviews and learning a bit of the history of the place. Unfortunately I think we ended up in one of the ""yet to be modernised"" rooms, which was very tired looking and the air conditioning didn't work. We also booked a double room and ended up with two (fairly small) single beds pushed together, not really what you expect from a quality establishment. That said the room was perfectly clean, and the bathroom was pretty decent. The pool and outdoor bar area at this hotel is very nice, we enjoyed a swim in the sea-water-fed pool and had some nice cocktails looking out over the ocean. Based on our experience I think you can find much higher standard rooms in Colombo for your money.",3
469,"Very efficient check in. Comfortable rooms.. truly experience of sunset of Galle face . we really enjoyed it, it was beautiful view , mind relaxing. friendly staff.  very close shopping mall, main  road, transport.",5
470,This place is magnificent loved its English Sri Lankan charm just delightful There's a museum anyone can see 2nd floor I think Overlooks sea staff were extremely helpful if I stayed in Colombo I look here only it's probably on the high side Great location too,4
471,"I stayed at the Galle Face Hotel for a couple of nights in May 2017. I most recent visited it last week just for drinks, but stayed at another hotel nearby. Itâs beautiful old hotel right on the Indian Ocean. Itâs a great place to stay with beautiful rooms. Itâs also centrally located and walking distance to some shopping and restaurants. The views are amazing at sunset, making it an excellent place to enjoy a solo or group drink and/dinner at the restaurants overlooking the water. One canât visit Colombo and not stop at this majestic hotel.",4
472,"This was my first visit to Sri lanks and I decided to stay at Galle Face, and I must say I made the best choice. This Hotel is Located right at the Indian Ocean ( next to Indian and US embassy) and has a Private beach. The view is mesmerizing, Rooms are clean and spacious and the staff is polite.,Being such an old property, this is maintained very well and kept very clean. Breakfast Buffet has a good variety and al-a-carte' is also yummy. I was doubtful of the vegetarian food but after having my dinner there, I was delighted. ,They have a sea facing pool and a pool bar, where you can enjoy your drinks and food and watch the sunset. They also have an in-house museum and jewelry shop where you can buy authentic gems and jewelry. ,P.S - I would love to visit again.",5
473,"This hotel is not worth the money. It is really expensive for what you actually get. The room is not that big, it has just a tiny window facing some houses roofs. It was really humid, all the clothes in the bag got wet due to the humidity and the beds felt like they were wet as well. Tv quality on the room was really poor, double image, pixeled... the shower wasnât great either. Really close to the wall which will make all the water get out of the bathtub while you shower. The room controls (lights) were like 30 year old. Overall experience wasnât great. Considering the amount of money we paid, weâre not happy with the results.",3
474,I am a frequent visitor to this wonderful hotel but this time i was given a room below my expectations. I went to the reception and met this wonderfully helpful Chanaka. He moved heaven and earth to get me an upgraded room. I thoroughly enjoyed my trip due to this mature approach by a young Sri Lankan lad.,5
475,Love this hotel is like travel through the thine in elegance. The staff amazing always help us in everything. We had the opportunity to see the flag-raising in the afternong while we eating the most spectacular food in front of the ocean ,5
476,"Building has a bit of history. Nice waterfront location . Decent breakfast choices. There is a Seafood restaurant which is on the ground level - below the Bar. Check it out !.  Dont expect new rooms. Rooms we had didnt have much of a view. We had one issue and that was with the towels. They looked really old and well used.  Staff were excellent: from the front desk, restaurants to Emanuel the Concierge  and staff at the Gym. Emanuel helped quite a bit to get our other trips sorted - so may Thanks.",4
477,"If you can't afford to stay here, definitely head over for sunset drinks and enjoy the view.  The hotel itself is gorgeous, historic and charming.  You can enjoy a high tea experience there or simply relax and enjoy the affordable cocktails. ,Our family loved the experience.  The staff were friendly and allowed the kids to enjoy the grounds whilst we adults just took in the views!",5
478,"If you are like me fond of history and heritage, then this hotel is for you. We were about to book the Taj Samundra when we came across Galle Face. The fact that it was established in 1864 was enough for us to read the reviews and we quickly made up our mind that this was going to be our place during the last night of our 5 days/6 nights tour to SL.,And we weren't disappointed at all!,What a location! Just across the sea, centrally located in the heart of Colombo. We were lucky to be there on the day a historic tour is organized (Tuesdays and Thursdays for one hour each) and we were completely in awe of the grand ball room and the library and other places.,We had dinner at their restaurant called Sea Spray. What an apt name! We could literally feel the sea sprays across our faces. A table right next to the sea, with candle light and authentic SL food...it was pure heaven.,Mid morning we had drinks at the pool side, sipping away with the waves giving us company. We would not have asked for a better way to close our trip.,If comfortable and good stay is important for you, go for this hotel.",4
479,I have stayed in many of the hotels in Colombo and this is a wonderful for being different. The location is superb - love listening to the waves crashing as I spent time by the pool and on the verandah. No traffic noise or trains as in some of the other âbusinessâ hotels. Service is excellent and food good. My room was a little âtiredâ but love the wooden floor. There is wifi but it is slower than some of the newer hotels. Will definitely return. As here on business very good rating not excellent due to wifi.,4
480,I was very satisfied during my stay in Colombo and would immediately recommend this hotel. The The sea food restaurant has fresh products for a moderate price. The room has partial view on the sea but was very happy of the equipments in the room and services.,4
481,"Nice hotel with a lot of history. Rooms are fine. Breakfast is great.,The hotel staff are great and very helpful.,Donât miss to visit the hotel museum.,There is no beach and a very small pool area. Windows in the rooms do not have blinds.",4
482,"This is not a 5 star hotel but it is a beautiful and charming 4 star hotel. The sea water swimming pool is a luxury. The restaurants are excellent. Room 3047 has lovely views.,Suggested improvements for management: (1) the bar staff needs to be improved. They are arrogant, grumpy, and lazy. They prefer to speak amongst themselves than to serve the customers. The cocktails are of unequal quality. Generally, the servings of alcohol are on the cheap side. (2) the chauffeurs: please train them properly.",4
483,"There is no doubting this hotels heritage as soon as you step in. We finished our trip here and I'm pleased we didn't start it here as I don't think anything else would have quite matched up! It really is a luxury hotel and it is wonderful to see the love that has been put into its restoration. We felt our last night was so special being here, even with the terrible weather and there being no alcohol as it was a holy day! But who cares when you're somewhere like this. Divine.",5
484,"So let's start with the pluses,They checked is in at 8 am tho check-in is at 2 pm,Allowed us to take breakfast on day 1 as the last day we were leaving at 4 am,Fabulous breakfast,Beautiful pool, view etc,Now the negatives,Agreed i booked the cheapest room but was v v v v tiny room 3030 with only the properties roof visible from the window,Room service food was terrible. Nothing like the breakfast at the verandah,The last night it rained in srilanka both outside as well as multiple places within My room. My clothes got soiled as water went into the bag also kept calling in the bed ruining the few hours of sleep we could get considering we checked out at r am. We did inform the staff but not so much so as an apology which is slightly upsetting after spending 350 dollars for 2 nights. ,I would go bk but definitely to a deluxe room. But i feel the staff needs to feel for their customers. ",2
485,"We started our Sri Lanka holiday with a stay in Galle Face hotel for a couple of nights. The location of the hotel is excellent on the sea shore with waves hitting the embankment. The view from the restaurant, where we had our breakfasts each morning, is to die for. There are some historical items including a small museum as part of the hotel which has a car that the Duke of Edinburgh apparently purchase for 12 pounds. The room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable and the hotel exudes grandeur.,The only downside for us was the service we got in the ""Travellers Bar"" one day for lunch. Otherwise a great stay.",4
486,didn't stay at the hotel but have been to the seafood restaurant a few times. If you come here don't join the residents on the terrace but make you way down to the beach and chose a fish for grilling and then eat it with the waves crashing right in front of you. Lovely and very reasonable price,5
487,"We ended our Sri Lanka trip at the Galle Face Hotel as a treat, so it was doubly wonderful to be offered an upgrade to one of the superior rooms (four poster bed, jacuzzi bath, room probably bigger than the ground floor of my house). ,The hotel is fantastic - pool area and bar opening out onto the beach (salt water pool is great). Really good, relaxed vibe. As you would expect, the hotel is clean, the staff are professional and friendly and made us feel incredibly welcome. ,We opted to do the history tour with Mistica - she was fabulous - really honest and authentic, sung us a song and shared the history of the hotel with us, as well as telling us more about Sri Lankan culture. This was probably a highlight of the entire Sri Lanka trip for me and I would say that Mistica is an excellent ambassador for the hotel.,Breakfast was incredible - so much variety, all very tasty. ,Thank you Galle Face for really spoiling us. Although, now I've got a taste for that life, I will probably need to come back sooner than I had planned!",5
488,"I stayed three nights with my girlfriend in one of the balcony suites. This hotel is superb, the room service is excellent. Having breakfast in the morning on the balcony overlooking the sea is a must. The sound of the crashing waves at night makes you fall asleep instantly. The staff are incredibly helpful and attentive, going above and beyond.,The hotel is magnificent and the pool is very nice. We had a number of cocktails in the afternoon watching the sunset. I would recommend a stay.",5
489,"We were 7 adults + 1 child + 1 infant who visited the 1864 for lunch on the 29th April. The food was delicious!!! The staff and service were super! ,Geethika from the restaurant was especially helpful in making the reservation and arranging a private dining area for us. ,Keep up the great work boys and girls!!,Nisha",5
490,"We stayed here for one night upon landing in Colombo, and the hotel is really a beautiful property. It is located right next to the president's residence, so as you drive there you can see lots of the important buildings of Colombo.,The property itself is right on the sea face, and from our room we could hear the sound of the waves crashing against the shore at night, which was lovely. Walking around you get a definite colonial era feel, and the hotel has lots of grand and majestic areas and the restaurant area from where you can eat and see the water.,Breakfast had a good variety and was fresh.,Staff were extremely polite and welcoming.",4
491,"This is a classic, old school, beautiful hotel right on the ocean. They provide consistently great service and the food is of high quality. The rooms have lots of character which we enjoyed - not the usual modern hotel rooms. And you can explore the hotel which has a museum and a library as well as multiple restaurants. And of course they have great views of the ocean from many parts of the hotel.",5
492,We recently stayed at Galle Face Hotel a second time and loved it. The breakfast on the verandah looking out at the sea is second to none. The food is excellent. The rooms are spacious and feel fresh despite the heritage look and feel. We love the pool overlooking the sea. Staff gave my two young nieces toy elephants to make them feel welcome. One suggestion: don't get rooms overlooking the road or the Galle Face Green as they can be a bit noisy. We have also stayed at the Taj across the road and the Kingston and think they pale in comparison.,4
493,"Have stayed before and was great to stay again , they arranged a room with sea view . The room was clean and bed linen was good quality , the only thing was the towels were a bit tierd in the room ,But the breakfast and the staff as ALWYS was very good ,Will come back again ",4
494,"This is a beautiful old but well updated hotel and the perfect place to land when we arrived to Sri Lanka after 30 hours of travel.  The rooms are lovely and comfortable and the restaurant, pool and bar feel like a grand hotel setting.  We loved the food- especially fabulous meal at the seafood restaurant.  We also really enjoyed sitting on the couches in the bar area- relaxing and great view.   While Colombo wasn't our favorite city, the Galle Face was a highlight of our trip.  Note: Tuk tuks are right out the front door and we got a great 2 hour tour from a knowledgeable driver for very reasonable cost-a fun all around experience.",4
495,"Galle Face was a wonderful refuge in Colombo. My friend and I flew from Delhi to Colombo for a week of Sri Lankan exploration. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a cool towel and refreshing drink. Our room was gorgeous and so tidy. The bath products were luxurious. Our balcony looked onto the ocean and all of this for $98/nt! We were able to get massages at the new L'Occitane Spa and the experience was second to none. I've had tons of massages and this is top 3 to be sure. The food was good but many options were buffet, which isn't my top choice. That being said, service was warm and welcoming, food was tasty and the room was spotless. Can't wait to come back!",5
496,"What a gracious old hotel! Everything about this establishment is old world charm and professional service.  Colorful uniforms, friendly smiles and greetings from everyone. Sea views from many parts of the hotel and the ever present sound of the surf crashing on the sea wall at the edge of the green. Excellent buffet for breakfast - if you haven't tried it do have the egg hopper and accompaniments (well if you have tried it - have it again). Bars, restaurants (including what we were told is an excellent fish restaurant right by the sea), balconies to sit and take in the sunset, a pool and sunbathing area, a library (with books to be borrowed), wifi, a small museum etc, etc.,ATM's around the corner to the right and a supermarket in the basement of the shopping centre next to the Cinnamon hotel (opposite side - cross Galle Rd at designated crossings - and yes the traffic mostly stops for you but take care)., You will enjoy staying at this hotel and feel sad to leave. ,Transport and tours can be arranged in-house. Tuk-tuks at the gate, staff will advise reasonable transport rates but may need to bargain anyway.  About 10 mins to the market area.",5
497,"We have always wanted to stay at this historic hotel and it didn't disappoint.It is probably the best hotel we have stayed in so far.,The room/suite was tastefully decorated and very comfortable.The window opened  up to the view out to the stormy sea. the fresh air a delight.,We were staying on a public holiday so be aware this means no hotels serve alcohol on these days . That meant only in your room so no sundowners. and sunset.It wasn't the weather for it anyway.,Special thanks to the wonderful Concierge Emmanuel Adikaram who made us feel welcome and special. In our experience not all 5 star hotels do this.,Cant wait to return.,My only criticism would be that the pool is not an easy access and could do with steps. and rail for those that find the ladder difficult.",5
498,"I just loved everything about this  historic hotel despite our room being a little small though compensated by a large balcony overlooking the garden and ocean. The food was   excellent especially the buffet breakfast which had a huge number of options and was served in the dining room overlooking the garden and ocean.. The swimming pool is beautifully situated next to and above the ocean (which is too dangerous  to swim in) The staff were exceptionally pleasant and helpful and we were fortunate enough to be able to take a free history tour given by a member of staff (Tuesdays and. Thursdays only currently) .The tour was very interesting and introduced us to their Museum which we might have missed. It contained photos of some of the famous people who had stayed at the hotel previously and even Prince Philipâs first car! Do not miss it! The hotel itself is furnished with antiques and there is so much wood used it is stunning,,as are the floral arrangements around the hotel.",5
499,"As you walk in to Galle Face Hotel, you are immediately taken in by the colonial grandeur it exudes. The staff is very courteous and polite, and the setting overlooking Galle Face Green and the ocean is unbeatable.,The room was OK - it is well furnished but for the size and grandeur of the hotel, they are relatively small. After a 13h flight we also didn't appreciate the screaming children jumping up and down on the floor above (to be fair, we did not notify management of the issue). The best feature was the large balcony overlooking Galle Face Green, which was a great spectacle to see on a Sunday afternoon, as it fills up with locals.,On the other hand the Sea Spray seafood restaurant served excellent seafood and fish, and the breakfast buffet (I am always weary of buffets) was excellent.",4
500,"The old colonial feeling. The whole buildings,  swimming pool, restaurants, the walk along the beach and hip vibe at night.",4
501,They don't have local cuisine that we wanted to have before leaving the country. The room is very small considering the value.,4
502,Loved this hotel! The staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. The breakfast was amazing - probably 1 of the best buffets I have had.,5
503,It was very quiet but this was because of the recent Easter Sunday bombings,4
504,"Loved the enormous salt water pool,, and the breakfasts , especially the freshly made hoppers I usually sat a little longer with an extra pot of chai overlooking the sea,, nothing was a problem. And brilliant front desk and concierge service",5
505,"Such a lovely stay at the hotel. We arrived just after the terrible news on Colombo and despite having army personnel around the hotel, the staff were so amazing at making us feel safe and at ease. As it was our honeymoon, the staff upgraded our room and sent bubbles and chocolates to our room which was a lovely touch. The room service was also so prompt and tasty. Weâre planning on returning in the future to spend more time here. Thank you to everyone at the Galle Face for being so lovely at a time of tragedy for Sri Lanka.",4
506,"The breakfast was incredible, the staff beyond helpful and the bedrooms were lovely. It was a truly great stay and I would definitely stay again.",5
507,"I don't have a bad word to say about the Galle Face Hotel, we loved every minute.",5
508,The history is amazing and the place is huge and beautifully presented. the pool is great and th eoptions for drinks and food are really good. Location is also perfect.,5
509,Nothing,5
510,"Staying here made for a wonderful first night in Sri Lanka. A gorgeous historic building that has been looked after so well. Lovely rooms, incredible evening buffet eaten under the stars, a fun Cuban bar on site to watch the sunset and a lovely clean pool. Wonderful location too!",5
511,Nothing!,5
512,"Breakfast was very good and varied as would have been expected from a 5 star hotel. Bed was comfortablePool was excellent overlooking the sea - lovely to relax and hear the waves lapping. Staff were incredible helpful and always willing to help even organising a taxi for us at the end for the airport. We did not use the hotel's cars which would have cost $70 to the airport and instead used  Kangroo Cabs which cost 3000 rupees.",5
513,"For what we paid, I was expecting a nicer room. Although we got one of the cheapest rooms, we still paid Â£165 a night for a basic room and breakfast - with a view over a unused courtyard and building which had paint peeling off its walls.  We had stayed in much nicer rooms throughout our stay, but I understand that you are paying for the location and to stay in a piece of history. One night we went to the hotels Cuban restaurant, My partner is vegan and even though vegan options were given, the food was bland and tasteless and we ended up spending Â£28 for 4 small plates and 2 mock-tails. I would not recommend eating there!",3
514,"Beautiful colonial hotel close to the seafront. Wonderfully restored to its former beauty. Great spacious and well-appointed rooms, excellent breakfast and dinner. Superlative staff with great service!",5
515,"Perhaps a little pricy, but worth it.",5
516,"An amazing place to stay in Colombo- friendly staff, incredible food, plenty of history to enjoy in a place that oozes style and takes you back in time.  Definitely recommend it!",4
517,nothing- I wish I could afford to stay there longer!!!,5
518,The greeting was great the room was good. Complementary fridge and a great house keeper. Loved the salt water pool.,5
519,Holes in pool decking that could cause injury,2
520,The property is beautiful and the staff is amazing and they even bring you fresh water bottles and fruit in the swimming poll. The breakfast is great.,5
521,Rooms are old but well mantained. Could use an update. We had a balcony and what we could see: another building...,3
522,"This place is a living heritage museum, celebrating bygone eras. Staying here is a must on your visit to Sri Lanka. The building is beautiful and classic, the service friendly and helpful, the food and drinks delicious. I strongly recommend having sundowner drinks in the courtyard and watching the bagpiper play as the Sri Lankan flag is lowered at sunset - what a remarkable experience!",5
523,The hotel is an iconic place. So much history! En joy the historic tour of the hotel to get the best historic insight of the property.,4
524,Pity the harbour and big buildings are coming towards the hotel...,3
525,A wonderful hotel in every sense enhanced by fantastic staff. Colonial style with grand staircases and wood panelling. Staying here is a unique experience. There are plenty of marble palaces nearby but once inside you could be in any city in the world. The Galle Face Hotel is Colombo.,4
526,Nothing to dislike.,5
527,The staff. The welcome and check in process. Having complimentary minibar items and welcome snacks. The happy hour snacks were delicious. The ocean view from the room along with the sound of waves crashing on the property's beach. The outside seating area of the restaurants by the beach. The suite size. The TV was big.,5
528,"The hotel is old but not in a charming way. It looks like it needs renovation. The carpets need replacement (they look dirty), the wood needs polishing and the wall needs painting. Some areas of the hotel smelled like sewers and some of the towels in the toilet looked so worn out.",2
529,"The hotel is very colonial - it literally breathes the history of older times. It is truly one of the main places to see in Colombo, we highly recommend it for a stay in the city. We stayed for one night on our way back home and we really regreted not staying there longer.The staff are AMAZING - welcoming, helpful, discreet. You truly feel the luxury and the tradition of quality. This hotel is a city within a city - there are so many things you can do - 4 amazing restaurants, splendid front line sea view pool with salt water, bars with an exciting selection of drinks, spa area, museum (how crazy is that?!:)), wime cellar.. Special thanks to the manager who gave us an upgrade and a complimentary early check-in. We were surprised that the hotel managed to overcome our expectations! Will definitely stay again.",5
530,I liked the food. The burger was excellent on the veranda. We also went to the 1864 French restaurant and the steaks were very good. Service was impeccable and all in all a great experience and end to our holiday.,5
531,Curtains werenât quite fitting the windows which was annoying in the morning.,3
532,Huge room and you can hear the waves when you open the windows. Great breakfast and iconic sunset,4
533,"The hotel is a bit tired and our room looked like t hadnât been used in a while. The staff was very quick in fixing it, but We let we had better experience in significantly cheaper places.",3
534,Old colonial hotel with memories of days gone by!,2
535,"Our room was in a wing on the side, however the passage was noisy with people walking and we could hear doors banging! It is a beautiful old quaint colonial hotel, as such the floor creek etc",3
536,Have stayed here many times. The hotel has refurbished and improved consistently over the years. I can't imagine staying somewhere else in Colombo.,3
537,"The room was great the staff was friendly and professional. We had high tea with invited friends rather than dinner which was fantastic.
",5
538,Nothing. Everything was perfect.,5
539,"Nice, big hotel with history. Beautiful terrace to enjoy a drink. Breakfast was vast and lovely. Nice pool overlooking the ocean.",5
540,Our room was okay but not as beautiful as where we stayed before here. ,3
541,"Great location, just a few metres from Fort wall and beach with views of wall and beach from balcony. Generous and tasty breakfast.
Friendly hosts who kindly offered to do a load of washing for us at no additional fee.",4
542,Nothing,5
543,"An exceptional colonial hotel with up to the second amenities. Wonderful staff providing excellent service.  Great choice of food and drinks, a truly fantastic place to stay in Sri Lanka. ",5
544,If you can fault this hotel in any way Iâd be utterly surprised. ,5
545,Everything about this beautiful hotel is perfect. The staff are wonderful. The breakfast is superb and the atmosphere/buildings are excellent. I will always return here when I come back to Colombo!,5
546,The location right on the water is stunning.  It was lovely to sit by the pool and overlook the ocean and have the waves crashing right there.  It doesn't get much more beautiful than this.  It is also very close to any restaurant or site you want to visit in Colombo.  The buffet breakfast was also quite delicious.  The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.,4
547,"Galla Face is a total refuge from the chaos that is Columbo. Lovely setting and sunset views, kind and very attentive staff, very good food - breakfast will be an abiding memory of our trip. The hotel is old school elegance and calm. Itâs a big place but never feels frenetic or over busy. You feel slightly like youâre in an episode of Jewel in the Crown - a real experience and we were delighted to top and tail our Sri Lanka trip here.",5
548,"Honestly, not a thing.",5
549,"Liked the always helpful staff. The location was excellentTheir Fine dinning restaurant was superb",5
550,NOISE....late night loud Thump Thump music from lower floor ...which made me angry as on booking I specified a quiet room ..the hotel replied and said for my 3 night stay I would have a quiet room...it wasnât quiet at all. Buffet restaurant needs an overhaul on food selection and presentation.,1
551,Really enjoyed our stay. The amount of food to choose from in the buffet was amazing. Staff very helpful and friendly. Room was good and pool area very nice.,4
552,A room with a balcony would have been nice but overall good,4
553,The hotel was everything i expected. I was there for the Ironman race and i was welcomed the minute i stepped in the door despite turning up with my bike and all my kit. The rooms are great. The hotel is steeped in history and this is reflected in every aspect of the place. I would highly recommend it when you are in Colombo. I fell asleep to the sound of the sea!!,5
554,"nothing, i loved it",5
555,"Location, swimming pool, atmospheric old colonial hotel, with a wonderful museum over the history of the hotel. The sunset, the lowering of the Sri Lankan flag at sunset.",4
556,"It was a very different experience of living in old colonial hotel on the coast of a bustling city of Colombo.  I did not have too much opportunity to explore the city (I only saw if from the window of the car going to work), instead I took the time to explore the hotel itself and it was an adventure.  For those of you who enjoy historical places, this hotel has a lot to offer!  It is worth to talk to the staff members about the history of the place an some slightly quirky rituals that the guests will surely witness :).   Even if the hotel itself is over 150 years old, it offeres all modern facilities.  I greatly appreciated the fact that the rooms are equipped with old-fashioned ceiling fans as well as the air conditioning.   This way I had a choice not to use the later and still stay cool in the room.  The breakfast buffet is excellent with a large choice of diverse dishes - both local, Western and also some Oriental.   Overally it is a good hotel for those, who want to stay in a place which is differnet from the modern Western style business hotels.",4
557,"Beautiful old colonial hotels. Great facilities, lovely big pool. Nice pool bar and Cuban restaurant. Drinks quite pricey compared to other hotels we stayed at in Sri Lanka.
Huge bedroom.",4
558,Silly light system all controlled from a key pad that you canât see in the night! Difficult to find a light switch to actually turn on! Air con was also difficult to use and so our room hot overnight.,3
559,"The ambience of the historic past, the building, the rooms, the location - all great",4
560,"Many groups of tourists, and the fact that the hotel misses a few âyoungerâ propositions - Cuban bar a good start... terrace area, long room can do with more of the same.... how can you make the hotel more interesting for younger  clientele?!
",3
561,"Again an old colonial style hotel . Rooms we stayed in were tired and a bit rough around the edges, I believe they are in the process of updating the rooms.With tax and service charge added on , prices for drinks, spa treatments and food were similar to western hotel prices. Nice salt water pool.Pool bar area good for watching sunsets, Sri Lankan piper announces sunset , and sri lankan flag  lowered overnight.Good breakfast buffets.",4
562,"Some mildew and fungus on wood in bathroom ,  manager told us  he would move us, but hotel full . Didn""t here any more from him and remained in same room. However they did scrape above off the wood !",3
563,"There was a fantastic welcome as we arrived in the morning the staff went out of their way to get our room ready earlier so we didn't have to wait until check in. Everyone was very friendly and provided fantastic customer service, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for making the start of my holiday in Sri Lanka one to remember.",5
564,"With a short notice, the hotel arrange to send me a vehicle to the airport to pick me up.",4
565,"In the check-in, the staff in the front desk assigned me  a room which is less than what I paid for.Upon bringing this issue to management, I was giving the right one.",4
566,Swimming pool and restaurants The Verandah and the Cuban by the sea,4
567,"Room was on 4th floor in one corner facing a tower with a soldier with weapon. It was big but old, bathroom had a leak. Old room old aisle.",3
568,Fantastic historic hotel. First class accommodation.  Pillows / bed great. View of property & ocean sensational. Breakfast buffet very nice.  Staff plentiful. Pool excellent.  Cheap tuk tuk to markets or shops in Colombo.,4
569,Canât think of any.,3
570,On the seafront but unable to swim in the sea.  Very efficient and friendly staff. Ok location. Access to many local hotel restaurants.  Complementary soft drinks and snacksin the room fridge. Hotel Cuban bar lively with good cocktails. 30m swimming pool with salt water. Spa and gym facilities good.,4
571,"No view from our room. Lots of building projects nearby, but this did not affect our hotel stay.",5
572,"Colonial grandeur - a delight to stay in this beautiful heritage building with such a rich history. Gin and tonic on the beachfront, a swim in the pool and a Sri Lankan curry buffet for dinner. Heaven! I never opened a door the whole time I stayed there. Staff were very attentive and friendly.",4
573,There was not a single thing to complain about.,5
574,"The staff were great, nothing was a problem. The breakfast is fantastic. The pool is clean and amazing spot for watching the sunset ",5
575,The lunch wasnât great ,5
576,"A historical and traditional hotel, beautiful place and wondelful property. The renovation is made very well, they have not destroyed the feeling of the palace. The room was big and well equipped. The staff is professional. We got very good dinners in the special restaurants and the selection of wines is huge.",5
577,"We had to wait more than half an hour before we got the room even that we arrived after 2 in the afternoon. They just forgot us sitting on the sofa. The buffetrestaurant is too big and restless, it was not nice to have at least breakfast there.",4
578,"We were very impressed with the check-in service. We arrived slightly early and were able to check-in after a short wait. The hotel is beautiful, in a perfect sea-front location and feels like stepping back into a long-gone colonial era. The room (junior suite) was beautifully appointed with two sea-view balconies, a feature jacuzzi bath and very comfortable bed.",5
579,"Unfortunately we were disappointed by the restaurant experience. We were staying at the hotel to mark a special occasion and I had made a dinner reservation at the Verandah at the time of booking. Upon arriving at the restaurant we were informed that it was buffet only that night (no a la carte) due to a private function in another restaurant. I felt the hotel could have communicated this at the time of booking, which would have given me the opportunity to make alternative arrangements. It also created issues for bathroom use as the usual bathrooms were off limits due to the private function, so we had to go up to L1 for the bathroom, which caused a further inconvenience to us and was disruptive to our special dinner. I felt the hotel prioritized the private function at the expense of other guests' experience, and I have to say this is not what I expected from this hotel. In addition, the buffet itself was not great, so what was supposed to be a special evening was a disappointment.",3
580,Love the location by the sea. Friendly staff. Amazing breakfast buffet.  Great massage at the spa.,5
581,Was offered a rubbish room with noisy road outside. I was upgraded after a little time so it worked out ok in the end.,3
582,"This beautiful, stylish hotel had no faults in my opinion; the restaurants and bars are diverse and excellent, the staff are charming and helpful, the building is magnificent  and even the small museum (housing, aming other things The Duke of Edinburgh's first ever car!). The museum also lists some of the previous guests at the hotel, including Cole Porter, Mark Twain, Noel Coward, Laurenve Olivier, Duke Ellington and Scarlett Johansson.  There's not much to be said for Colombo, so it's just as well that you feel like hanging around the hotel all day!",4
583,"We came in late desk duty were very curtious and efficient, bell staff were the same and then on top of that we were upgraded to a sea view suite wonderful way to wake up in the morning.Thankyou",5
584,Old colonial style atmosphere. Bedroom comfortable and beautiful.,5
585,"No view whatsoever from bedroom.Slow service in bar area during lunch time. Quality of food served during the various buffet services and the seating ambiance of the restaurant could be much better.",4
586,Despite being a large hotel the staff still make it feel very friendly. The fact that the hotel has its own seafront and has retained its sense of its history makes it feel quite special.  The hotel catering was excellent.,4
587,"The best hotel in Colombo, and probably in all  Sri Lanka
Colonial atmosphere,  perfect service, and excellent breakfast",4
588,Cost much more than the alternatives,5
589,"The bathroom was perfect, the room very comfortable, even had views. The pool and pool area was wonderful.",5
590,Breakfast not included. Otherwise there was nothing to not like!,4
591,Airport pick up service was excellent.  Beautiful breakfast on the veranda. Tried the Siri Lankan specialities.   Had great tea with pastries.,5
592,Our stay was to short.,5
593,"This hotel is over 150 years old and it is well reflected in the overal ambience.  For travellers who like hotels with the difference, it is a very pleasant experience.   Even a tour around the hotel is like sightseeing.   I also liked the location.  Right by the sea [althought the beach is not large], a great position to watch sunsets.  It is also close to a busy city promenade where you can immerse yourself in Colombo's life, so different from the slightly posh atmosphere of the hotel.Breakfast it very good.  A wide range - local and European food.  Very fresh and tasty.  Meals are served on the verandah which allows to feel the warmth and sea breeze.   Hotel has few bars, including a latino bar with life music.  The rooms have fans as well as air conditioners.  Fans are bit noisy sometimes, but for those who can't stand air conditioning this is a good alternative.  Staff is very helpful and patient.  Like everywhere in Sri Lanka.  Overall, definitely a very pleasant experience.",4
594,Sometimes I felt I was getting too much attention.   But this is just a cultural difference :),5
595,"Beautiful historical hotel that has been well maintained. The location, staff, facilities (especially the pool) were all fantastic and deserving of the 5 star rating. Thank you for such a wonderful stay. ",5
596,Nothing! ,5
597,"Galle Face Hotel is one of the iconic hotels of the past and lives up to its reputation. Compares to Raffles, Eastern & Oriental and Peninsular hotels.",5
598,My only criticism is that Colombo itself does not provide enough interest to support a lengthy stay at the hotel.,1
599,"Everything youâd expect to find in an historic hotel like this. Staff amazing, great facilities, room well presented and restaurants/bar good too. Enjoyed our stay!",5
600,"Unfortunately some ants had made there way into the mini bar, but this was quickly rectified by house keeping and the contents replaced (so not really an issue). ",3
601,"Iâm struggling to think of positives. The hotel was ok, nothing special stands out.",3
602,"The waiting staff were sometimes attentive and other times completely ignored you. It was really hit and miss. We stayed in 8 other hotels during our tour of Sri Lanka and experienced far better service elsewhere.
The food is overpriced and mediocre. Again we had much better food elsewhere on our Sri Lankan travels for less than half the price.
The pool is small for a hotel of this size and there are not enough sun beds.
The room appeared clean at first glance, but look again and you can see that the rug hadnât been hovered etc.
We could also hear noises from outside which disturbed our sleep.
We will look to book elsewhere next time we are in Colombo and I would advise you do the same. I couldnât recommend this hotel.",2
603,"Great location by the water, equipped with a gym, spa and pool.  Love the Veranda area! Love the breakfast spread! Service with a smile! ",5
604,If staying during the week of national day beware of parade and celebrations that result in road blocks in the morning til lunch time.  If you arrange for driver I find they themselves along with hotel do lot know how bad traffic will be or when Road will clear.,4
605,Very grand hotel. Historical features still in place. Good selection of bars and restaurants on site. Nice pool size which was not over crowded. Staff were attentive and well mannered.,4
606,"Noise from room above very loud due to wooden flooring and furniture if moved above and also noise in corridor travels very far. Room was small, basic and in need of a touch up especially considering the grandeur of the hotel.",4
607,"This is an historic and elegant hotel which is fully updated while retaining much of its historic character. It is in a stunning position right on the coast.  The staff are plentiful and accommodating, food is good and there are a number of restaurants to choose from, breakfast was an extensive buffet featuring european and Sri Lankan dishes.  We used the hotel three times as a base in Colombo on our trip and would use it again",4
608,"One of the rooms we stayed in, while having great views, was situated above a bar which played music late at night.  On the plus side, when we complained to the management about our disturbed night, they acted promptly to ensure that we were given a quiet room for our next night at the hotel.",4
609,Very good breakfast buffet. Helpful smiling staff. Good location. Easy to get passing taxis and tuk tuks. Interesting little museum with Prince Phillip's car. Attractive general areas.,4
610,Awful bare unattractive small room. Only one bedside light. Basic overhead shower. No bath. Tiny bottles of cheap shampoo etc. Room not cleaned by 4 pm so just obtained replacement towels from passing cleaner. Towels thin and frayed.  Bar food was served cold and soggy,2
611,All the magnificence of a grand colonial hotel. This property is well maintained with modern facilities but retains its grandeur & elegance.,5
612,Gluten Free bread was disappointing.,3
613,the breakfast spread was vast and really good! the view from the pool-side bar & dining is simply spectacular,5
614,"floor boards were creaking :) it was charming for us, not sure about the neighbors on the below floor!",5
615,Fantastic old hotel in excellent location. Comfortable bed in lovely large room. Overall the hotel seems caught between being an axclusive first class hotel and a mass market offer. Loved the sea views and the history of the place. Sense of fading grandeur.,4
616,Air conditioning in room could not be adjusted. Very noisy and much too cold. Bathroom ok but in need if upgrade to be first class. The hotel falls between premier and mass market. It would need an upgrade to be the former but is too expensive to work as the latter.,3
617,"Bar and restaurants were excellent,  especially the Cuban bar.  The love music the was fantastic!!",5
618,"Rooms were a bit dated, but designed to look authentic for time period. ",3
619,"Great food, good service, lovely historical feel of the hotel.Pool and location cannot be better!",4
620,"We had a very annoying check-in at 1am in the morning (room not ready and had to wait until 2am) - however, manager apologized next day",3
621,amazing views/location and front of house facilities - Restaurant/breakfast on site - Simply stunning !,5
622,The bedrooms ! very ol/tired and in need of a refresh,3
623,Iâve stayed there several times and always loved the old colonial style and rated it v highly . Vg cocktails and staff too,5
624,"Since last year I feel it had gone down hill . They kindly upgraded my room so no complaints but glad only there one night as view over back and roof tops and room nothing to pontificate about , so no major advantage ,whereas before I had a view over sea, front and Galle face green. Also little things like soap dish chipped in bathroom, lighting not great. Breakfast buffet deteriorated , choice more limited and had run out of emmental cheese which one doesnât expect of hotel of this calibre No idea about dinner buffet . Dined at Cuban restaurant instead but sad seaspray had gone. Overall seems a bit scruffy compared to my previous stays.",3
625,"The ambience of this place and the attention to detail was extraordinary. The Royal Dutch suite was truly luxurious with views over the water, and the complimentary chocolates to recognise wedding anniversary, as well as upgrade to access pre-dinner champagne and canapes in the Long Room, while watching a beautiful sunset was truly memorable. The swimming pool and pool service was second to none. The Library is well worth a visit too. Wished we could have stayed longer...",5
626,Nothing at all.,5
627,"Pleasant dinning, great staff, good location. Good live band one night.",4
628,"Paid for a deluxe queen room. Room was small,view of a dirty ally-way,and showed its age.,",1
629,"Colonial history, design and location. Cuban restaurant was excellent and great fun with excellent staff",5
630,"The evening we were there there was a major corporate event which dominated the main ding area and bar area. The majority of the terrace was closed to residents and the music was over bearing and far too intrusive.It is quite simply that paying guest enjoyment should be compromised in this way. We should have been warned and the room rate reduced as we were unable to use all the facilities advertised and the event took over the whole outside area.The outside bar area lacks atmosphere and just doesn't feel right when it should be brilliant. More thought is needed on the detail to create a truly colonial feel.I do not think buffet service for Dinner in the main terrace restaurant is what one expects of a international hotel. Bit like being at a Club Med resort.",3
631,"We had a wonderful stay in the Galle Face during pre-christmas time. A fantastic feeling in the traditional house. Scenic view, friendly staff and beautiful colonial style decoration. Love it!",5
632,"The room was a bit oldish decorated for such a traditional house it is a pitty. The food was average, with a bit too much Sri Lankan taste.",3
633,"The location of the landmark hotel is brilliant. as well as the history. The management is there poor. Rather uncomfortable for the lady travellers. No personal touch, no guest relation appointed managers we met. no welcome we have experienced. as much as we regret.",4
634,Location is brilliant as well as an atmosphere of the landmark hotel and the ambience. When service is missing....,5
635,The old world charm but still new looking.,5
636,I booked through booking.com. Reception somehow missed that I had alreadypaid for 2 of the 3 rooms Iâd booked and accidentally charged twice for one room. This could have easily been avoided if record keeping was done well. There was unnecessary hassle caused at check out.,4
637,Gorgeous heritage property thar takes you back in time. Delightfully luxurious as well and stunning location.,5
638,Canât think of anything other than a temporary mix up about our booking at check in. Communications between booking.com and the hotel shouldâve been clearer and more prompt.,5
639,Excellent location very comfortable and clean. Staff very accommodating. Colonial Architecture just Brilliant. Loved breakfast on the veranda. Drinks in the Evening at the alfresco Cuban bar a must .,5
640,Air conditioning wasnât working properly in our room however the technicians fixed the problem almost immediately.,4
641,Fabulous location and a very comfortable and stylish hotel.  Works as a place to relax as well as visit the city.,4
642,"The reception desk were a bit unwelcoming - it was sunset and the hotel has a tradition of 'piping' down the sun which is fun to view.  Our receptionist messed around and never said 'welcome' and we pretty much missed it.  Poor training for a hotel of such quality, but I stress that wasnt true of all the reception staff.",4
643,"Location - you can walk nearly to every landmark in the city. 
The swimming pool nearly at the beach. 
Choice of restaurants and bars (yet the speed of service could be improved, especiallly at King of the Mambo!)
Friendly and helpfull staff!
You should try the spa offer, especially the massage (ask for firm tratment and leave really relaxed)",5
644,"Room was rather loud, mainly due to not sound proofed doors, with a lot of noises coming from the corridor - source were guests but also housekeeping employees, active early morning (6-8 AM) - we couldnât sleep well
Bad smell as a result of humidity (in the room and some of the public spaces)
The price of airport pick-up / drop-off servcie is above average (even comparing to the Blacklane package of comparable car standard)",3
645,"Location is very central and unique as the garden is directly on the seafront (most other main hotels are separated by the main road). The swimming pool is spacious (40 m) & uses sea water. Direct view of sunset. 
Breakfast spread is varied and well presented. The common areas have maintained some of the original style of this historic hotel. Excellent clean & modern gym. ",4
646,Rooms Are a bit dated and would need an upgrade. Wooden floors tend to be noisy despite carpet flooring. ,3
647,Manager was not welcoming or service-oriented when receiving us at the hotel and discussing the room rates. Not the gracious service typical of 5 star properties.,5
648,"Facilities and decoration transport you to the early 20th century. Pool, restaurant and bars are well decorated and are perfect to spend days, weeks, months",5
649,"Elevators on the back section could be better maintained. Other than that, thereâs nothing else I didnât like",1
650,"Beautiful Colonial-era building, everything was immaculate and food was excellent. The whole look, feel and atmosphere was wonderful. Rooms are decorated in keeping with the era. Service is top class.",5
651,Room rate was fairly high but it was peak Christmas & New Year season so to be expected I suppose.,4
652,Right on the sea front. The building holds so many historical features and it is beautiful.,4
653,The meals and drinks menu is not clear about tax not being included so final bill almost doubles.,3
654,Good terrace overlooking the water for food and cocktails,4
655,Wasnât allocated the room I requested. The room smelled of damp and little concern showed by staff to resolve. Eventually I was moved but not without a fight which was a real shame.,2
656,Property itself was beautiful and the staff very nice,5
657,"Taxes are not included in the room rate or any of the menus, when booking this should be clearer as was much more expensive than advertised. ",2
658,"The location is great, easy to walk to the old Dutch hospital development, or the shops at Crescat. A short tuk tuk ride to Barefoot, Paradise Rd and The Gallery Cafe.",5
659,Nothing.,5
660,"itâs a beautiful old hotel and fun. With lots of friendly efficient staff. Chanaka on reception particularly helpful. I needed him to print a contract, to sign and then them to scan it back to me... which they did without fuss and very quickly ð",4
661,"Nothing.. itâs a beautiful old hotel and fun. With lots of friendly efficient staff. Chanaka on reception particularly helpful. I needed him to print a contract, to sign and then them to scan it back to me... which they did without fuss and very quickly ð",4
662,"A wonderful historical experience. Charming and elegant. The real Surprise was the King of Mambo downstairs and outside on the lawn. It is a must for any visitor. great atmosphere, food and setting, and lounges.",5
663,nothing,5
664,Good hotel for our short stay in Colombo. Great location as very close to local Laksalas for shopping and to other tourist spots.,4
665,Room was not well-lit,4
666,A nostalgic visit had not been to Galle Face since 1959/60 or thereabouts. The resident historian gave a run down on the changes since then. ,4
667,Nothing to say all good,4
668,"It is  a great hotel. The service, the staff, the look and fell...  Everything is simply excellent.",5
669,"The only downside is that it is fits for couples. If the staying is surfing purposes, I would not recommend stay there (especially with kids - the hotel doesn't fit for kids).If you have honeymoon or just want to relax as a couple, this is exactly the place to do so!!!",4
670,"Beautiful setting, traditional colonial style really enjoyed our stay. Food and drink reasonably priced for this star hotel. We were upgraded to a suite which was amazing.",5
671,"Dirty bath, black bits in water when Jacuzzi was used ",2
672,"The hotel's charm is unparalleled. The location is unbeatable. Old world hospitality, lovely nooks and crannies across the property and lovingly preserved traditions. Great front desk experience.",5
673,"Still scope for improvement in housekeeping services, room upkeep. Hotel cab rates are way above normally paid around Colombo. Tighter management overall will help.",3
674,Great location and colonial vibe,4
675,Food at beach bar was very average. Chicken satay served undercooked and slightly pink. Staff very helpful and ordered again but still under cooked.,3
676,"The heritage hotel is a realGem. Loved aperil spritz on the verandah viwwimng the sunset and the taking down of the flag with bagpipes in tow. Truly moving",5
677,Nothing,5
678,"1. All extra comfy!2. Scent of the hotel!3. staff always brings you in person when you are lost! 4. Hotel car always ready in a span of short call 5. Concierge really looks after your messages6. All smile happy staff7. Relax environment8. Management runs towards you when there is an issue not run away fromyou9. The old wood floor10.  The black and white photos in the museum who visited the hotel since it opened.  Including so many royal families and politicians and US presidents and James Bond actors 11.  Sunset ceremony12. the breeze",5
679,"additional telephone for bigger rooms and I have to run to answer the phone.  If I was sleeping, I cannot go back to sleep coz I had to answer the door or the phone by the time I go back to bed I am awake!  Need Chargers at the bar!  Sound system improvement and spa needs improvement",2
680,"Has so much potential to be a great hotel. However the building is run down, customer service staff have very little concept on what they are doing and at times rude and unhelpful. Food selection in restaurants was poor. Seems to cater for a primarily middle age British holiday maker demographic with pre purchased holiday packages.Also had an awful experience with some missing jewellery that had been delivered for us from another hotel. Galle Face have refused to accept any responsibility for this despite it going missing whilst in their care. We will pursuing this legally.",2
681,The British Raj at its absoloute best.,5
682,"It didn't bother us but seeing as a question about the beach appeared, you couldn't bathe, but it was no issue at all to us as the pool was magnificent",4
683,"Location, historic building and staff",5
684,Room description on booking.com differed to hotel website. We were moved after 2 days but made to feel as if we were complaining when we actually only wanted the suite we thought we had booked.,1
685,Itâs got great character and the restaurant is very good with good variety of evening meals. Breakfast was ok. Staff are fantastic. Beds are very comfy. Great location to go walking and exploring. Plenty of tuktuks outside if you want to go anywhere.,4
686,Itâs an old building so you can hear people moving around on the floor above which can wake you up. Room smelt a little musty or damp but nothing major. ,1
687,"Beautiful historic building. Wonderful dining. Buffet at breakfast was a great variety and huge buffet. English, Sri Lankan and to order eggs any style. Nice drink selection and pool. Wonderful place to recover during an extended journey. ",4
688,Our room was noisy from a wedding below us. (They moved us immediately no problem. Very service oriented). ,4
689,The staff were very kind to us when we arrived very early in the morning after a long flight and found us a room to occupy by mid morning at no extra cost.,3
690,Nothing at all.,5
691,"Loved the Long room for canapÃ©s and drinks in the evening. Breakfast was amazing. The staff could not have been more helpful. We had suites on the fourth floor overlooking the ocean, they were very quiet rooms.",5
692,Everything. Itâs a lovely colonial style hotel. With seniority and elegance. The Cuban bar is great. I will definitely repeat if I go back to Colombo.,5
693,"Nothing, everything was great",5
694,"We liked the Genius Loci of this place, the proffessional service, great breakfast, possition, the pool, lobby and the bar.",5
695,"We believe that the superior room we had needs refurbishing, it is quite worn out for a 5 star superior room",2
696,Classic old colonial feel. Really nice bar/terrace area,5
697,Rooms are old fashioned - not necessarily a criticism but some people might want a more modern bathroom etc,4
698,"Friendly, courteous and helpful staff. Excellent choice of food in Verandah restaurant. Breakfast was superb and bar snacks were delicious.  Good choices for dinner.Room very comfortable and fresh fruit offered along with free non alcoholic drinks in fridge",5
699,Nice grounds and beautiful old building.  In general staff extremely nice.  Buffet breakfast and lunch were very good.,5
700,"Booked connecting rooms 8 months in advance, upon arrival we were told the interconnecting rooms are small and unsuitable, ended up in two separate rooms and had to split our young children between rooms.  If theyâd told me that 8 months in advance I would have cancelled the booking.  Ended up being a disaster of a two night stay and they didnât seem to care at all.  Rooms are old and tired with archaic control systems.  Staff were nice but service was agonisingly slow even by Sri Lankan standards.  Terrible value for money compared to other hotels in the city, youâre paying for the history of the place more than anything else.",2
701,For historians a delight this old and famous hotel. Some of the rituals (such as an unusual ceremony every sunset) were very enjoyable.,5
702,"The rooms' bathroom needed some maintenance, but upon return to the hotel some days later all were very apologetic and a free upgrade was granted.",4
703,"The colonial charm of the hotel and its location overlooking the ocean, which was perfect for watching sunsets. Also, the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. A bonus was the quality and variety of food served at the buffets.",5
704,The room was a little small and there was a step up to get into the bathroom which could be a bit hazardous in the dead of night.,4
705,"Very comfortable as one expects with a 5* hotel of this stature. Lovely staff, quick & helpful at reception, excellent breakfast! Interesting to meet the gentleman doorman who has 52 years service with the hotel. ",5
706,"Some more sunshine would have been good to try out the pool, but nothing the hotel can control! 
",3
707,I am a repeat customer.  I find this hotel ideal.,5
708,"The beds in the old wing can be a little small, and the bathroom has a window into the room, making light blocking difficult.",3
709,"Beautiful views, friendly waiting staff and great breakfasts. ",5
710,"Noise. Wooden floors and noisy people in the room upstairs meant I was woken at 1.15am on the first night and a party until 2.30am on the second night led to bad nights sleep. The spa was a bit disorganised and deep tissue massage was not deep tissue and not very good. 
Avoid if you want to sleep. I checked out a day early and management response was pretty poor. ",2
711,As hotels around the world slowly become indistinguishable from each other this hotel is unique full of surprises and as helpful and friendly as you can be. I loved it and I'm coming back.,4
712,"Beautiful building, furnishings and setting.",5
713,"The noise of people in the room above (wooden floors).The service from the hotels booking team, who rather than honour their advertised get three nights for two deal which wasn't working on their website, just removed it.",1
714,"The breakfast buffet is incredible. The walk from the room to the restaurant beside the beach is fantastic. Very relaxing atmosphere in the middle of busy city.We stayed here for our honeymoon and the special attention they brought to the presentation of the room was wonderful. Great service !",5
715,"Beautiful colonial style hotel. Great wooden floors and historic fittings and furnishings.
Rooms are comfy with upmarket /old school feel. Pool is excellent with an amazing view of the ocean.
Location is great to get to some of the points of interest in Colombo.
Buffet breakfast has a great selection.
Also shout out to the pool bar staff who got us some buffalo curd and tikal even though it wasn't on the menu. ",4
716,Nothing really. Parts of the hotel exterior need a bit of TLC ,3
717,"This hotel truly lives up to its reputation as the finest hotel east of the suez. We checked in last minute, as an addition to our honeymoon travels and we were so glad we did! Amazing location, decor, staff, facilities and food. Would definitely recommend the Galle Face to anyone travelling in Sri Lanka.",5
718,"The building is fantastic. The hotel has really that classic stylish look.
Rooms are clean.
Breakfast is excellent.",5
719,"There is many staff around, however theyâre not that focused on service and creating that special atmosphere. Eg waiting times for checking in and out are much too long.
The area around the hotel is dramatically changing.
Hotel is slightly overpriced for what you really get. Itâs not that special experience I hoped to get.",3
720,"Staff were very friendly but not overly helpful. Swimming pool was amazing. The pool bar is also great for snacks and drinks almost any time of day. 
The building itself is just gorgeous. The galle face green is right next door and is a great spot to take in a sunset and sea breeze. 
The fort district is only a short walk and there is a shopping mall across the road. ",5
721,"The room wasn't as clean as it could have been. A pair of false eyelashes left in the shower were waiting for us the first time we used it. 
We called reception three times for assistance we never did receive. 
Price gouging when leaving. Don't ask for a taxi they will provide the hotel car for more than double the price of an actual taxi. Take an uber using the hotels Wi-Fi instead. ",3
722,"The whole hotel is an experience from beginning to end. Just walking around this beautiful hotel is like sight seeing in museum.  Their traditions such as the 6 oclock piper from the hotel to the shore, the two weddings we were lucky enough to watch.  All perfect.  Just one little problem.  The door between rooms (locked) did nothing to stop the noise next door.  We could hear teaspoons clinking, conversations, etc.  Luckily for us we had two considerate neighbours.  Not sure how that noise could be reduced.  Guess next time I would definitely ask for a room with no shared door.  However this is a beautiful hotel , on an amazing point of land in Colombo so make sure to go there (and ask for a room without door)",4
723,Only the shared door probem,1
724,"We returned to this fabulous colonial oasis after 36 years and it was more wonderful than before. The hotel is charming and is a reminder of a bygone era.  The staff are very much up to date about the importance of friendly, efficient service and are able to communicate extremely well with travellers from all over the world. A smile goes a long way and there are certainly many of those from the hotel staff.  The restaurants, bar, pool, museum and grounds are top notch and make for a very romantic interlude in a very busy city.  My husband and I highly recommend The Galle Face Hotel.",5
725,Leaving,5
726,"The location, unique
The atmosphere, timeless
The hospitality, formal yet warm and unobtrusive
The seawater swimming pool
And now the spa...",4
727,"Nothing, I am always satisfied with the best",5
728,We were placed in an (upgraded) room above thumping music that kept us awake. 'Just till 11.30pm' we were told when we called reception. Appalling at these prices! We had to demand a change of room in the middle of the night - very inconvenient. Never again!,1
729,Well preserved colonial relic ,1
730,F&B staff at buffet area needs to be more proactive; the young trainees at Reception desk need better training and improve on their customer service attitude ,5
731,"almost everything was perfect. the beach front location. the heritage elegant property. the beautiful artefacts. the gorgeous beach front pool bar. the little private beach. the creative nooks & corners ... overall a dream stay ! would like to mention the team members Sampath at airport, Lalith & Sajid at the long room, manoranjan on floors, dannika at the verandah, Amila the front office supervisor & Malitha at reception & of course Mr Sadique.  So many others I dont have the names. they create awesome experiences for guests !",5
732,"need more lights in the room and also light above the bathroom mirror. 
a lady at front desk called Nasheetha was quite rude & not helpful. ",3
733,"the hotel is the best place I have ever stayed at - the view from the room, the hoppers for breakfast and the sunset on the patio are incomparable - thanks",5
734,"This is a fantastic hotel for a splurge. Yes, there are more affordable hotels in Colombo, but you need a night here to experience all the Dutch colonial charm. The staff were so accommodating, great rooms, amazing food and a wonderful experience.",5
735,This hotel is full of old world charm and the experience was fantastic.  The staff throughout and very helpful and pleasant.  Great location.  Would definitely recommend.,5
736,The room was a bit small.  We had an ocean view room with balcony but the cushions on the outside chairs were filled with rain water and there were no towels to use the outside lounges (though they soon arrived when requested).  The fridge did not work very well.,5
737,"The hotel was in a great location and had a lot of charm,  The staff were great - especially those who welcomed us on our arrival at 3am!",5
738,Just outside the door to our room were all the spare beds/mattresses.  This was not a good look.,4
739,"Beautiful property which is built ON the beach, so you can hear the waves from almost everywhere in the hotel. So it gives you an unmatched resort vibe while still being located in the heart of Colombo city. They have preserved the grand heritage of the hotel very appropriately, we stayed in a 42 Sq.m junior suite with a huge private balcony facing the ocean. It doesnât get better than that.",5
740,"The staff were a little lazy. People didnât offer to help with luggage on both instances which was very surprising to me. The food also was acceptable but not a smack out of the park as one would have expected at a big 5 star in Colombo. Afternoon high tea at the veranda must be the most beautiful tea spot in Colombo. However the tea choices were disgraceful. Air conditioning in the room could have been a little more powerful, I suspect like most hotels they reduced the airflow between 2-5am.",4
741,What can one say about the Galleface Hotel that has not being previously said. This is an exceptional hotel and everything about it oozes five star. It should be on every traveller's itinerary to spend at least a couple of days at this hotel. We will be back.,5
742,Breakfast. ,5
743,"The room was very small and bathroom doors had problem. Not value for money. Had stayed here earlier, was given a better room. Not idle for old people and people on wheel chairs. ",3
744,Great spot great pool and nice bar and restaurant ,5
745,Not really value for the money you pay compared to other places. Concierge service not overly helpful,3
746,Balcony suite was wonderful & breakfasts excellent. Nanna wonderful breakfast manager,5
747,External paintwork was in a poor state especially front of building. Selection of drinks at happy hour in long bar was poor. If you are going to have a happy hour then make it a real happy hour otherwise I would have preferred to see the piping of the flag down at the main bar downstairs. Small front beach contained a lot of plastic litter that should be the responsibility of the pool attendant to clear every day. I picked up a lot but without a bin in sight all I could do was inappropriately give it to the breakfast bar attendant.,2
748,Wonderful old colonial charm to the hotel! Staff was friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious! They even surprised us with champagne in our room for our honeymoon!,5
749,The superior style rooms have very thin walls so you can hear everything in the next room.,4
750,The hotel staff were verry attentive. Great pool. The rooms very comfortable and the daily breakfast second to none. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.,5
751,"Stay at this hotel for a sense of grandeur and history. It feels a little like going back in time, in a good way. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was about the size of a London flat, and very comfortable. Everything was polite and professional.",4
752,No complaints.,5
753,Excellent location. Spacious rooms. We were upgraded to junior suite. Had a seaview and view of pool deck. There is so much history and tradition at this hotel. The small museum is a must visit. There is also tours of the hotel on certain days. ,4
754,Nothing not to like. Staff at the Verandah restaurant were so helpful but we ate at pool restaurant one night and found the staff unhelpful. They need to up their game to match the other areas of the hotel.,3
755,"Great room with a view, we were upgraded and also had a cake waiting in our room as it was my birthday. This was a very kind touch which was much appreciated.good location to have a drink and watch the sunset as well.Beautifully preserved features in the hotel, classic compared to many of the more bland modern hotels nearby.",4
756,"There was an event taking place on the chequerboard/area in front of the bar/restaurant and by the beach the night we stayed. We were not informed of this in advance or when we checked in and you could hear everything through the windows as our room overlooked it. That would have been ok as it finished reasonably early but the crew then started  to dismantle all of the props and metal structures that were in place for it. They woke us around 12.30 with the noise from doing this as they took no care to do this quietly. They continued doing this until after 2.30 am (I donât know when it stopped!) as I eventually fell asleep then (with ear plugs on!). I didnât ring down as I kept thinking that surely the hotel staff would see and hear what was going on. Also, they obviously wanted them to dismantle it that night rather than next morning so I donât think calling down would have made any difference as I doubt it would have been stopped just for us. It seems such an odd thing to do at that time of night in the first instance. If we had been informed in advance of this event, I would have asked for a different room.When we checked out, we werenât asked how everything was but I did bring this up and the manager was called. They were very apologetic and offered an upgrade if we stayed again but couldnât do that as we said we were leaving Colombo. They then gave us 2 bottles of water..It was a shame as it is a lovely hotel but due to being older, there is capacity for a lot of noise through the windows and under doors at night. I would perhaps return if I was in Colombo but not anywhere near the busier parts of the hotel and I do not think it is worth some of the rates that were quoted on booking.com (we got it last minute for cÂ£100 which was ok). We stayed in Paradise Road Tintagel the 2 nights before and found it much more relaxing, calm and very professional staff.",2
757,"Nice colonial propertyRooms were very spacious and well maintained despite its age Lovely sunset view from the terrace and pool Complimentary minibar",4
758,Nothing,5
759,The staff were most helpful and welcoming. The room was very well appointed and the views great. The breakfast sÃ©lection was good. ,5
760,The coffee was not good. ,4
761,"Beautiful colonial hotel; we stayed in a Junior Suite with an ocean view balcony, absolutely magnificent room. We ate in the 1864 restaurant and the meal was faultless. Thoroughly enjoyable 48 hour relax at the end of our holiday - weâll be back one day. ",5
762,Faultless but a word of warning - we were able to book an airport taxi for Â£4K (local currency) less than the hotel service offered - look locally!,5
763,"Beautiful building with fabulous salt water swimming pool and views out to sea.Lovely room with view over the Green. Good breakfast.",4
764,I was asked on way out if I was checking out because I did not come from reception desk. It was not a pleasant ending,4
765,Location was good.,4
766,The staff were not very attentive. Very inconsistent with training as there seemed to be no standard. The staff did not wear their uniform with pride.  I choose the hotel based on its history and location. I expected the staff to be better. Hotel interior needs a good refurb. I would not recommend to others as there are many better close by.,3
767,"The range of restaurants and their beautiful settings. Loved the location on the waterfront. Magnificent pool. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Beautiful colonial building and peaceful atmosphere.",5
768,Nothing.,5
769,"Amazing old property refurbished right on the sea. Hotel has a great history and a museum inside.Great central location. You can spend hours in the coffeeshop looking at the sea!!!
Mine was a short stay so i cannot comment on the food but looked like a huge spread .Excellent staff. Very caring. I fell down outside the hotel and was hurt. Quick medication and manager himself came to see me and called few hours later to ask if i needed anything. Bellboy   smiled in greeting when he came to pick up my bags even   as early as  2.30 am  in the morning.",5
770,There was nothing not to like..,5
771,"We were upgraded, so possibly not the most objective review, but the hotel itself is just beautiful, with the colonial architecture preserved and accentuated. The staff we excellent and the food (we only had breakfast buffet) very good.",5
772,The pool is sea water. It's warm though.,4
773,The hotel has a great atmosphere - really takes you back in time. Also level of service is very high. Great romantic place for a couple,5
774,N/A - we had fantastic time,5
775,"The staff at the reception is very rude and non-professional. But I only had bad experience with one staff. Other staffs at the hotel is very helpful. The hotel is has easy access to supermarket, shopping center and beach. Jewelry store is worth to visit. The breakfast at the hotel is good.",4
776,"Customer service. The hotel is old,  needs renovation.",2
777,"the hotel is amazing and walking in its big rooms and corridors reacalls you all the past of the hotel and its prestige. The room was big, confortable and very clean. The mini frigo was included with a lot of local products that we enjoyed either for the taste and as well for promoting national products. The staff was really carefull and nice altought they had lot of work as the hotel was full of people. The swimming pool was very big and the sun beds very confortable. We did not used the restaurant as we thought it was a bit overpriced if you compare with other options in nearby first class hotels and in any case that night menu was with international food and we prefered a more local option. But still it was very good looking.",4
778,"Is a bit difficult to find something that was not as we expected. Of course the price is a bit high for being in Sri Lanka, but it is still cheap exspecially if you think back to your country where a luxury hotel would cost half of my salary per night. We also used the pick up service at the airport that  was kind and professional but I found out that many agencies provide it 40/45 % cheaper.",3
779,"This hotel is a true gem. A historic hotel with ample charm and character , all brought upto date for a modern stay. Although there are many luxury 5* hotels popping up near Galle Face I couldnât imagine missing the opportunity to stay here.",5
780,The charm casts a spell that smooths over any cracks!,1
781,Gorgeous rooms. The pool by the ocean a lovely place to lounge on a hot day. Old world charm and a great central location. Treat yourself to a night here. ,5
782,Pricey but worth it. ,5

784,Nothing ,5
785,"Visiting the museum within the hotel. The sense of history. The cocktails in the bar. The flag removal ceremony at sunset. The very comfortable bed
The upgrade to deluxe side sea view :) ",4
786,"No bath in bathroom 
The muesli ",4
787,"The Environment, The Location everything is top of the notch.
The staff! They were unbelievably helpful, polite & generous. Everything is beautiful & elegant. ",5
788,"They added extra 30% of tax on everything without mentioning it. Even on Booking.com.
After I guaranteed by credit card (Non-refundable) the hotel & Booking.com said the fare excluded 30% of extra tax.
Even the dinning menu or In room dining everything is charged with 30% extra without mentioning. This is frustrating. ",4
789,"The overall ambience, location of the property, staff courtesy , house keeping is of good quality.The hotel is a very old hotel , has good history and is very well kept. The staff is mix of young and senior employees who are very friendly and happy to assist any time.",4
790,There is nothing i can say i did not like.,4
791,"This hotel is an absolute gem, one of the best in Asia. The look is classy and has kept its old charm but modernised the experience. Amazing staff are accommodating and the view of the sea is fantastic.",5
792,Nothing!!,5
793,"Hotel very old and made of wood so there are a lot of insects. Breakfast is the same everyday (staying there for 5 days). Staff chatting very loudly in corridor, impolite when answering phone call, and purposely avoid opening door. There is no washroom door separating from bedroom so it's very cold when taking shower due to aircon from the other. Soundproof is very low (wall is not made by concrete - tested after knocking). In room dinning options is very limited. To make the matter worse, the food quality is very bad.",2
794,"a perfect hotel which takes you back in time  to the british colonial era.A beach facing hotel , old style building adds class.very helpful staff and comfortable stay,",5
795,na,4
796,"The age, history and beauty of the place are clear. In its time and even today there is a certain opulence you donât get with a modern hotel. The staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful. The room is tastefully appointed and the bathroom had a beautiful hot shower with plenty of space. The bar staff near the pool were exceptionally helpful and kind, also they make fantastic cocktails. Sitting ocean side in the evening while the waves crash against the ocean wall with the warm breeze is magic.",5
797,The room I was in had an ant infestation. I mentioned it to the staff who told me it was an old building. I think the language barrier may have been a problem but I had ants all through my bed. If I put food down for two minutes sure enough the ants would swarm the plate. This made me very uncomfortable the first night but I forgot about it the second and third. Due to the age of the building and wooden floors the wood creaks and groans. The large doors at the ends of the corridors bang loudly and I could hear people talking in rooms far down the corridor or coughing at night. These little things are nothing more than an annoyance but it does lend to the age and beauty of the building.,2
798,"Huge room, great bathroom & shower, and the breakfast/lounge/bar areas looking out onto the sea front are brilliant places to spend time any hour of the day.Particular favourite was bagpipes at the flag raising/lowering",5
799,"Beautiful old hotel with a rich and interesting history which has bee very well refurbished.We loved looking out at the sea and it has a good pool area.",4
800,"The room was pokey ,too small with suitcases and only a place for 1 case. Our room was on the main Galle Face Road so rather noisy though it quietend down in the middle of the night.Please watch out for the local touts who pounced on us as soon as we left the hotel on foot claiming to be a member of staff and wanting to help us cross the road. We were exhausted and did not pick up on cues that we both felt we would have on a normal dayDo not use tuk tuks in Colombo just get the hotel to arrange a taxi.Maybe we just were unlucky but our day was expensive and unpleasant.....Happy to say we have met nothing but kindness since leaving Colombo!!",2
801,The Galle Face is a hotel full of charm and old colonial style with period furnishings but up to date facilities. The staff were all so friendly and polite and we absolutely loved staying there and would love to stay again. Breakfast was probably the best one that we have ever had  - the buffet had everything that you could wish for! At sundown complimentary cocktails were served on the seafront with canapes and a 'Beating the Retreat' ceremony by the Sri Lankan pipes and drums - simply fantastic!,5
802,Nothing!,5
803,"The staff were lovely, particularly the reception staff. Friendly, helpful, warm. The setting is beautiful also, just if they could tidy up around the edges it would be even better again!",4
804,"The hotel may be a heritage hotel, but that doesn't preclude good maintenance and regular updating of fittings! The food at the bar is also very bad, warmed up frozen food. Gym is embarrassingly small for this grade of hotel.",3
805,"Location, clean, good food, no pests, great laundry service",5
806,The bathroom flooded every time the shower was used & everytime we got it dried it was never fully dry,2
807,"Beautiful, old fashion style hotel - like something out of a 1940's movie. Location makes it easy to move around Colombo. Can eat in the hotel at the restaurants close to the beach listening to the waves from the ocean crash into the sand/rocks.",4
808,"Room was tiny and lacked space for a business traveller (even with an upgrade). There was a fruit bowl and chocolates left in my room (nice gesture) but ants had attacked and this resulted in ants roaming around the room on the desk, in-and-out of my laptop. Condensation problems in this hotel means clothes hung in room do not dry, but rather seem to get more damp with moisture, even with air conditioning switched on. Wi-Fi was exceptionally poor in my room. Almost unusable so I just gave up which was frustrating as my stay was for business. Gym is nice but way too small and lacks modern day equipment e.g. only 2 treadmills meaning a wait time which is inconvenient.",2
809,"I always stay here in Columbo. I like the staff, the views of the Indian Ocean, the location and the furnishings, but most of all the beautiful building itself and the sense of colonial history. I also like the pool and pool area on the edge of the ocean and - sometimes- glorious sunsets.",5
810,Nothing that springs to mind.,1
811,"I like the atmosphere, location and the staff's of the sea breaz. 
Front desk staff's too are really good.",4
812,"There were lots of noise near the room, minor staff's were shouting and gossiping near the room. (Cleaning Staff's)
Management issued us a letter saying that certain things are complimentary and on discount, but restaurant staff's are not aware about it. 
Person who came to check the mini bar was really rude, he ask the reason in delay in opening our room door.
Linen were too old, look faded.
",2
813,Such history!  The interiors are incredible.  Location is perfect.,5
814,"Im not a fan of Buffet style eating, otherwise this hotel is amazing.  There is another fancier restaurant though to dine at.  Despite that, I would still stay at this hotel again.",4
815,"Old world charm with modern elegance.  Staff were helpful, friendly and were more than happy to assist you in any way. Emanuel, the concierge, was passionate about the manner in which he approached his job. His assistance was invaluable.",5
816,"The Galle Face was terrific... Its position and history and old world charm. The rooms were massive, I'm sure we were upgraded to a suite - we had the best balcony (and I will miss the resident crow!)",5
817,One badly booked meal (fish) on one occasion at the pool bar.,2
818,The breakfast was very good and the buffet dinner excellent.Not enough choice during lunch.The staff were extremely helpful to arrange all the needs,5
819,"The first room we were given as an upgrade  was not in good decorative order and had a big bathtub in the middle of the room, which means it is not an upgrade in the old wing which needs to be reburshed.",3
820,The colonial style building and central location ,5
821,Our 3 teenage kids arrived into Colombo at midnight. It was 2am before they arrived to the hotel. Although we had already checked them in there was no bedding or towels for the 3rd person. I think a bit more attention to detail is important ,3
822,Location,4
823,"Went with the family. We got overcharged by the hotel. Staff and managers are horrible and they try to trick you once u check in and offer a free upgrade but then u realise that it was not free. Food is really bad. Rooms wr full of insects and ants, but they changed our room. Carpets inside the room are too old and stinky. And all that was fr 300$ per day. Never again.",2
824,The Galle Face Hotel is a colonial heritage masterpiece filled with all manner of colonial charm and ambience.  The 30m salt water pool was wonderful as I like to swim 2kms every day.,5
825,The cost of the driver from airport to hotel was very expensive.  The people that assist with external excursions didn't appear to be all that keen or willing to make much of an effort to provide assistance.,3
826,"Lovely Colonial hotel, great setting overlooking the ocean, a number of nice bars/restaurants in the hotel and friendly staff. Room was spacious and clean.",5
827,"The room was very comfortable for our first night in Sri Lanka. The hotel is beautiful, colonial style, with lots of 'hidden' gems (we stumbled across a museum storing Prince Philip's first car!). Service was excellent both at check in/out and in the seafood restaurant. Food was amazing too, very fresh and reasonably priced. Pool was clean and pool staff friendly/helpful in bringing towels, mats and drinks. Highly recommend if you have a night or two in Colombo.",4
828,Nice outlook,4
829,"The crows that flew around the property and into the restaurant, staff could have made a better effort to reduce their interaction with guest experience.",4
830,The fudge on arrival! Big pool and a lovely choppy sea view.,4
831,"Front desk staff - ignored us when we first arrived and then didnât feel the need to say weâd left sunglasses on the counter when we checked out. We were in a tuktuk before we realised and came back and the glasses were still sat there. Thereâs so many staff in the reception. Also the man managing the pool literally pulled sunbed mats from under people at the mere flicker of rain. They got wet when people swam so a little OTT.",3
832,I read a few reviews saying this place was a bit tired and shabby. That must have been before a makeover because it's stunning now. The spa is the best quality that you would find in London and the rooms are really beautiful. Great food and cocktails and not particularly expensive. The room is significantly more expensive than most places in Colombo but it's definitely worth it. You won't find this kind of old glamour anywhere else.,4
833,"We checked out a lot of Colonial Hotels during our Sri Lankan holiday and this one tops them all. Staff were so friendly and accommodating, my room had a lovely view of the sea, huge bath, the outdoor salt water pool was fabulous, and they even have bagpipes playing to take down the flag at dusk. Donât miss the chance to stay, absolutely a holiday highlight!",5
834,Service tax not included and not really clear until the bill comes. Otherwise no issues at all!,4
835,"The hotel is gorgeous, especially the newly renovated rooms. The second floor has amazing large balconies, great for evening drinks. The restaurants were also very good. All the staff were amazingly helpful and lovely, responding positively for all our requests. will be certainly staying there again on my next visit to Colombo.",5
836,"Room service can be a tiny bit slow sometimes. But if you're one a balcony enjoying the view, it doesn't matter much.",3
837,"As described, the atmosphere and the breath of history is really impressive. The staff, especially at reception really friendly, helpful and very polite, top ð",5
838,"I really cannot say, what I disliked. It is an amazing, huge hotel, where you can breathe history, kind of hotels, I usually like more, then these super modern hotels. Staff, especially at reception was extremely friendly and helpful, sure top class. But leaving the hotel, there was missing this wow effect, wanting to stay another night.",4
839,"Wished we had stayed longer to fully experience what the hotel had to offer. The building itself, and the staff were amazing. Bed SO comfy! Sadly we didn't get to have breakfast :(",5
840,That we weren't there long enough!,5
841,"Location is excelllent, rooms are clean and nice ",5
842,"Staff was impolite, room allocation was horrible, with two infants they made me change 3 rooms before the room that i had booked was alloted, happy hours manger was very rude and bad behaviour.",1
843,"This place is an absolute gem and completely worth the money - it will really make your stay in Colombo very special. From the beautiful rooms, variety of restaurants and gorgeous pool, this was an excellent hotel. I highly recommend it.",5
844,I had my wedding ceremony at the hotel and they went out of their way to make sure that the weather didn't dent our celebrations! excellent customer service and very friendly staff. The oldest/prestigious hotel in Sri Lanka gave the best service which is on par with the industry.,5
845,"If you like the movie Casablanca you will love the famous Galle Face hotel. The staff, service, and food are delightfully elegant in an old world way. The building and grounds are magnificent. We enjoyed the spa which is well run and clean. The food is one half English style and half Indian-Sri Lankan. The outdoor restaurant is sooo pleasant. The room was airy and spacious. Complimentary snacks and fantastic room service. Loved the experience.",5
846,Weâre sorry we had to leave.,5
847,Beautiful colonial style hotel great location... We were there on a Buddhist holiday w/e with wonderful festivities and lights around the city but no alcohol served anywhere when we were dying for a G and T by The Indian Ocean at sunset .. Which is why you stay at Galle Face!,5
848,"The GFH was stunning in every aspect, the food, rooms, pool. There is such a grand old-world feeling to this hotel. We loved everything about our stay.",5
849,Staff were really friendly and helpful. We got a tour booked for Sigiriya and Dambulla and it was really nice organized.,4
850,"This hotel is not worth the money. It is really expensive for what you actually get. The room is not that big, it has just a tiny window facing some houses roofs. It was really humid, all the clothes in the bag got wet due to the humidity and the beds felt like they were wet as well. Tv quality on the room was really poor, double image, pixeled... the shower wasnât great either. Really close to the wall which will make all the water get out of the bathtub while you shower. The room controls (lights) were like 30 year old. Overall experience wasnât great. Considering the amount of money we paid, weâre not happy with the results.",3
851,"We only stayed overnight after flying in to Colombo.The hotel was well kept overall.The staff were friendly and attentive. The room was a good size as was the bathroom. We had a nice view of the bay.The breakfast was substantial.",4
852,The bathroom had a fair few cracks and could've been a bit cleaner.,3
853,View was divine .. room great service excellent .. we loved the buffet and Seaspray restaurant.. we will look forward to coming back soon and wish we could have stayed longer,5
854,"Beautiful traditionsl historic hotel, so much Old Ceylon charm! Great bed pillows. Nice staff.loved the museum and the Travellers bar.",4
855,"The restaurants charge a fortune..we went to the seafood restaurant expecting top seafood, we had a cold shared seafood dish -  but it was tasteless and small quantity, service was poor had to ask several times for the waiter to come over...we were really disapointed.  Bed was also uncomfortable but pillows were great.",2
856,I was only like the location,4
857,"In the name of Gall Face I thought its one of the best place to stay in Sri Lanka, Finally I have realized that I have made the wrong choice. I would not recommend to anyone this hotel anymore and I will never go there again.I was there with my family for a short stay and I was totally disappointed about the food and the services that we were received, I paid about AUD500 Per day, but its not worth what I paid.Specially, there's nothing to eat in the buffet, most of them are empty, also, labels are  incorrect,  there are many issues which I could not wright here. And it's not good for the star hotel like this. hence its effect to the reputation of the hotel and to the Country.Thanks",5
858,"The view was great to enjoy your breakfast on the veranda. The food and service at breakfast was wonderful. Meal in the fine dining restaurant was just perfect. Staff very friendly, informative and helpful.",5
859,"Difficult to get to room on 4 floor, very confusing. Very dark in  bathroom to get ready, no natural light. Room on road side so a little noisy. Air con only effective if on high all night.Hit and miss depending on the room you get i think!",3

Incredible location and amazing atmosphere 
Got upgraded to an amazing suite ",5

863,Room had a slight drain smell.,3
864,Amazing location...couldnât ask for anything better. ,5
865,Food variety could be improved. If they donât have enough occupancy they donât serve buffet breakfast or dinner.,3
866,This hotel has the best position in Colombo with a wonderful seawater pool right on the beach.  It has been sympathetically renovated with very comfortable rooms but still retains a nostalgic grandeur.,4
867,"This was our second stay at Galle Face Hotel. It's full of old-world charm, the service is excellent, and the food at 1864 is delicious. The spa is far better than it was two years ago. Overall, a great experience. We'll definitely stay here again.",5
868,"The breakfast could've been better. While some items were very good, others were rather bad. It's a bit of a hit and miss.",2
869,Staff were fantastic helpful and friendly. The breakfast and themed dinner buffet was excellent. The spa was amazing. I would recommend this hotel to others.,5
870,"Location and people Good , Breakfast Excellent and Chef was so co operative to support for Pure Veg Food and Guided us.",4
871,"Carpet very dirty , In Room too much ants .Though they know I am handicapped having walking problem they provided room is south block which far away from lobby and breakfast area",3
872,The location was great and the building beautiful,5
873,"I was told that I would have a sea view but was put in the back by the linen storage cupboard!  Food in the bar was truely terrible - samosas that were cold and rubbery and also a club sandwich made with stale dry bread.   Overall a disappointment. Some style but very little substance.",2
874,"Location is great. Hotel is iconic and well preserved.Nice museum.",4
875,"There is no beach.Very small pool.Crowd invade the dinning area near the pool once food is served. N Edâs to be addressed by management.",3
876,"Always a great place to stay in Colombo had a sea view room , breakfast was very good and as ALWYS the staff super helpful and friendly",4
877,Towels in room a little worn and no complimentary water at the pool as in previous visits,4
878,"This is a beautiful historic hotel that has some amazing features to it. We loved the museum and the restaurant, we also sat out at the seaside bar and had a late coffee, it was a wonderful location. ",4
879,"Amazing location, very nice hotel. The buffet was one of the best Iâve tried with an excellent price and variety. The hotel is well maintained. The staff are friendly, I had a problem with the WiFi and they took care of it in a few mins. Excellent place to stay. I asked them for a cake for a celebration and they had it in the room right on time. I definitely recommend it. ",5
880,"We returned to this hotel to recapture a treasured memory after having our first meal in Colombo there when we honeymooned in Sri Lanka 6 years ago.They kindly gave us a room with a sea view.  It is a grand old hotel and the buffets are to die for. We had breakfast both days. The swimming pool overlooking the ocean is great. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.",4
881,"The rooms are in need of a bit of TLC. Although we love the authentic vintage of this hotel, a little bit of sprucing up in the bedroom and bathroom would make a world of difference. It is expensive to stay here and the cost of food and drinks matches this.  We knew that when we booked so thatâs ok.",3
882,"The food in the restaurant was excellent and there was a good choice. The saltwater pool was large and deep, and warm!",4
883,"The room was not in good condition - it felt tired and some maintenance was needed on the towel rack in the bathroom. The smell from the drains was very noticeable.  More significantly, and what really ruins the hotel, is that the staff attitude to guests was poor, with an air of self-importance which shouldnât be present in such an expensive establishment.  The staff on the pool bar were lax and more interested in chatting with each other than serving. Very disappointing.",2
884,"Loved the property - beds were very comfortable, rooms were clean, staff very friendly and knowledgeable, enjoyed the 'club' room, salt water pool was nice. Would definitely recommend this to others - especially if they like historical things - restoration is beautiful.",5
885,Have no complaints.,5
886,Beautiful building and classic location. The wedding receptions are pageants.,4
887,"Synthetic - or, at least, blends - towels in the bathroom - which did not absorb water - and synthetic serviettes in the restaurant. Resupply of the room was a bit erratic. Food was okay, but not great.",3
888,Great location and really nice staff and wonderful ambience!,5
889,Could have been more chairs in the room. Only one. Or other places to put clothes. Bad towels.,1
890,"Wow, from the moment you walk into Galle Face Hotel you know that you are in for a good stay. An incredible old building in immaculate condition with friendly staff and great facilities.",5
891,"Helpfulness if staff. Celebration day on 15/4 was lots of fun with drummers, dances & games. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Chef Brian was cheerful & happy to explain all about Sri Lankan foods.",4
892,Making a mistake - my partner & I both accidentally made a booking each. The hotel upgraded ð¤us one night at our request but no cancellation â¹ï¸,1
893,"Owners did a great job of maintaining the history and heritage of the property, while also providing modern comfort. There are small niggles (minor fit and finish issues, leisurely response to some requests) - but would recommend to take it as part of the charm. The gentleman hired to scare off crows with a slingshot outside the breakfast place is a remarkable anachronism.",5
894,"Request to set up an extra bed took half an hour and a reminder before it got done. There were minor imperfections in the room (slightly askew hole covering the ceiling, rattling bathroom fittings).",4
895,"To be honest: We read a lot about it and were a bit sceptical but the Galle Face hotel surpassed our expectations!
Beautiful wooden floors, breathing history in every corner, very friendly and helpful staff, located right by the Indian Ocean, amazing breakfast, clean and well air conditioned rooms, very nice and long saltwater outdoor pool!
Like we said in the title: A perfect place to stay your first few days when you arrive in Sri Lanka",4
896,Only negative point is that from the hotel you have to look at the Harbour being build opposite the hotel ruining your view!,5
897,"Excellent staff; the breakfasts were lovely and the rooms extremely comfortable and well appointed. The pool was fantastic and loved the location at the far end of the Galle Face Green. Made for a pleasant stroll into the Fort area. I had trouble checking in for flights on my mobile and was able to use their business centre to do so and print my boarding passes. The common areas are also very beautiful, you can really feel the history in the hotel without it being run down. Room service was excellent in quality and delivery.",5
898,"My experience in the spa was horrible (that being said, my sisters was fantastic and they did offer me 15% off my service based on the feedback they asked for right after the treatment, even though I didn't ask for any compensation). I found the buffet dinners at the Verandah the two nights we went (Japanese and Indian) to be OK but overpriced for what they were. Unless you are a big eater, I would go with a la carte.",5
899,The staff were extremely helpful. I liked the free minibar despite no alcohol in it. I loved the building the history and the museum. It had some great pictures throughout the hotel. It was a great last hotel of our holiday. We were treated very well.,5
900,View of the docks and ufgly buildings that now surround it.,4
901,Location & ambience,5
902,"Financial discipline. I was charged double for my room. A pre authentication of $ 250 was excess charged to my credit card instead of cancellation of the pre authentication.This is unexpected for a booking through Booking.com. We will lose confidence on the site if this continues.",1
903,Local Sri Lankan food at Dinner and Breakfast was excellent.,5
904,"Unfortunately not the best place for a woman travelling alone. Before 8 am in the morning, a male staff member unlocked and entered my room while I was in the bathroom. After I spoke out, he quickly backtracked and I confronted him in the hallway outside to query his presence in my room. His excuse was to do my laundry, which had not been requested, and why would that require room entry anyway? Next, during breakfast in the Ladies Washroom downstairs of the bar area, a male staff member stood grinning in the doorway as I came out of a cubicle to follow me (dressed modestly in long sleeves and long skirt) to the stairs making suggestive remarks. Although the Hotel Manager expressed concern about the incidents, sadly I will not consider to stay again alone in this place.",3
905,"This is the only place to stay in Colombo. Directly on the beach in an iconic area. The hotel has had a magnificent make over. Old world charm overlain with everything that you would expect from a 5* hotel nowadays. Lovely wooden floors and large, well equipped spacious rooms. The hotel staff were lovely and very helpful. The food was excellent and the most amazing breakfast. The salt water swimming pool was a treat and watching the sunset in the grounds and the piper piping down the flag at the same time was a treat.",4
906,Nothing,5
907,"Lovely old hotel with lots of charm. I would stay here again for a day or two en route somewhere else in Sri Lanka, as this is (in my view) a transit hotel not a holiday location due to no beach. Ask for room 2044!",3
908,Reception and check-in staff. Delayed our check-in by 30 mins and tried to put us in a room that was lower than the standard we had paid for. This started our stay with a bad feeling about the hotel. Staff are good but could be better.,3
909,The breakfast was the best I had in Sri Lanka. Nice big room.,5
910,Very expensive. For this price they should include an airport shuttle at least. Also the hotel taxi driver overcharged me for a very short journey. Avoid them and use the tuk tuks.,3
911,"This a great old colonial property, essentially modernized, with a convenient setting in the center of the city.  The facilities were beautiful and well-maintained.  We stayed in the premier balcony rooms and enjoyed a spectacular view, a comfortable room, and access to an open-bar happy hour.",5
912,"This is not a perfect 5 star top-class hotel; the staff can be a little erratic, and the rooms have some wildlife and history despite their refits.  If you expect 5+ star perfection, this may not not for you, but if you have a little patience and enjoy some quirk with your heritage, it's a wonderful place.",5
913,The breakfast buffet is fabulous and the attention to detail by the front office staff and concierge is wonderful.,5
914,"The service in the Traveller's Bar was chaotic. wrong drinks delivered, drinks missing.  Needs attention.",2
915,"Loved it. We got a good rate so perhaps not the best room so we didnât have a balcony (which is hard with young kids) but hat was our mistake! Museum, library and pool all great facilities. Also absolutely loved the fine dining restaurant bar",5
916,Location and hotel are amazing. Graceful colonial building in original style. Hotel is adjacent to Gale Green and walking distance to Dutch hospital shopping area. On site food is good and reasonably priced.,5
917,"Service is hit and miss. To give an example (could give more) ordering a cab at the reception was a painful undertaking where I was sent by reception, to concierge, to an empty taxi stand to a porter who sent me back to reception where I was asked to call myself. Typically upmarket hotels canât arrange a taxi for their guest. Not here (unless you take the overpriced hotel taxi).",2
918,"The hotel has been beautifully brought up to date keeping the gentle ambience and features of the old hotel, combined with the comforts of modern living. Everything you need and more. Staff were efficient and very friendly - nothing was too much trouble. ",5
919,The only thing wrong was that we didnât stay long enough. ,5
920,"Fantastic historical hotel, renovated not too long ago. Beautiful building with very nice historical details. Great service and very good restaurant. The bar outside is amazing with sea view. Favorite hotel in Colombo",4
921,Beautiful heritage building near the ocean,5
922,"Small room. Poor wifi which kept getting disconnected, mould in the bathroom edges, air conditioning died in the middle of the night. wake up call late by 30minutes!",1
923,My wife and I were treated like royalty!  Every detail was properly taken care of with excellence.,5
924,"I see my settings on Booking.com must be wrong.  I am an American, but this review states that I an Sri Lankan!  Never mind who I am, the stay was exceptional.",4
925,The hotel is run with efficiency and professionalism geared towards the comfort of guests.  The rooms are spacious and well-serviced and the staff strike the right balance between attentiveness and respect for your personal space.,4
926,The menu at the restaurant would benefit from the inclusion of more sophisticated dishes in both Sri Lankan and European cuisine.,5
927,The staff were wonderful in particular Kumar who looked after us in the long room. The swimming pool was well run and staff were accommodating in trying to find you a space at busy times. The gym although small did the job and the personal trainer there was a gentlemen. House keeping staff were friendly and accommodating also. Overall I was very impressed and I would definitely stay here again.,5
928,I didnât dislike anything,5
929,"Beautiful and recently refurbished hotel. Excellent location, food and good service. One of a kind really. ",5
930,"Arrogant and condescending front desk staff. Extremely unhelpful during check in and reluctant to give a warm welcome. When asked to extend stay they said this was only possible at a fee of 380 USD which is a shame as later that day we got notifications of booking.com offering rooms at 100 USD. This really gave a negative twist to our overall stay.
The fact you cannot pull up in a tuk tuk is ridiculous. This is Sri Lanka and not Monaco - please get a grip. 
With the ongoing real estate project on the west side of the hotel the view will soon be that of any major city and thus be ruined. I think the atmosphere the hotel boasts will be totally gone as Colombo is getting to ready to be the next Dubai.",3
931,The hotel has a wonderful history and is located very well.,5
932,"The windows on the side of our room were filthy. The blinds were pulled down on that side and the cleaners ignored the windows behind, like for years. The bath was also not clean and when you turned on the jets, loads of black gunk came out. The staff were generally quite snooty and were not overly keen to provide good service.In general the hotel is a little tired and very over priced.",2
933,"Staff was very friendly and prompt supporting (especially Mr.Manoj). I travel once a yr to Colombo for biz, this is the 1st time to Galle Face and for me it has the best compromise quality/price.",4
934,"The hotel has a rustic feel to it, it has character, and at the same time provides all the modern facilities. Right on the sea, views are great.",4
935,"service in the restaurant was not always efficient, waiting to be serviced",4
936,"We always stay there. Everything works, the food id great, the position unrivalled, and you can't beat the retro-Imperial chic of the Real Thing. Also, the gym's been fixed with new kit.",4
937,Nothing,5
938,"Beachfront, colonial charm.",5
939,"Surly staff, the only hotel we stayed at where the welcome was indifferent. When the power failed 0630 as we were leaving, we dressed in the dark and were unable to use hairdryer, manager said it was my fault for not having reported it, despite it being quite inappropriate for a workman to be in our ( 2 females ) room as we were dressing and packing for an early airport departure. no apology. Poor service, no hand towels or dryers in the hotel loos.",1
940,"For our final stop in Sri Lanka we chose to stay in a nice room in a nice hotel and picked the Galle Face Hotel.  We had a junior suite with a private balcony and lovely spa bathtub.  It came with breakfast and free happy hour drinks (which we sadly couldn't take as much advantage of as we would have liked).  Not a cheap place to stay, but very luxurious and would have been nice to stay another night or two.  We were delighted to find the hotel had a library - and amused to discover the museum.  It is a charming colonial hotel and the most formal place we stayed at in Sri Lanka.",4
941,Many coastal places have seagulls - Galle Face Hotel has crows and they will steal the food off your plate if you're not careful!  They also went after my hair a couple of times.  One of the restaurants has someone employed to shoo them off with a laser pointer which was somewhat effective.  Occasionally the air conditioning was a little fierce.,3
942,"Was a lovely stay the staff were lovely particularly Shiraz on reception he was very very helpfulLooking forward to returning again soon. Bedroom was lovely, excellent shower and very comfy beds.  The breakfast choice was exceptional",5
943,We liked everything,5
944,Location is by far the best among all other hotels in Colombo.,3
945,"Interior of the room is old could have been updated.  I am sure there are better rooms at higher prices.  However, there are far better and newer hotels with better services are available at better prices.  This hotel is betting on the past fame than the actual current state of the hotel.",2
946,Watching the sunset from the bar and the piper piping down the flag is very moving.  Hotel has teal style.  Great free mini barwell stocked.  Comfy bed very relaxing,5
947,"The Agatha Christie atmosphere, location, food, staff come from another world, unfortunately passed away...",5
948,"Who cares ?...you don't want it to be perfect..",5
949,"I stayed at GF twice. The first time I was lucky to be upgraded to a suite, where i was lulled to sleep to the sound of crashing waves.  The second time was in a beautiful room too.  I enjoyed leisurely buffet breakfasts......so many choices. thank you.",5
950,Another very enjoyable stay at the GF. Love the old world charm and the packed breakfast box kept us going on an early long railway trip. Very thoughtful.,5
951,Nothing. Staff used to be a bit offhand but no longer all were really helpful. A good couple of night's stay.,4
952,"Great location, property beautifully restored",5
953,Rooms are small and service is extremely slow in the restaurant. My sorbet came to me in a slopping mess after having had to wait nearly half hour for it.,2
954,Great setting and heritage.,5
955,Our room had no view. So check before booking. The car service based in the hotel turned out to be by far the most expensive we used while in Sri Lanka.,2
956,"We stayed at the GF on the first night of our trip to Sri Lanka and loved it so much that we decided to stay on our last night as well. Perfect welcome from staff, who were kind enough to upgrade us so that we could be closer to the pool, a cuddly toy for our new baby, beautiful room with Jacuzzi bath, delicious dinner and breakfast. Can't recommend highly enough.",5
957,"I have never been so inspired by anywhere quite like the Galle Face Hotel.Itâs rich in history, incredible art works, the hotel decor is so classic, yet warm and inviting. It uses a range of textures, fabrics, woods and colours. The people who make the Galle Face so inviting with their warm smiles.The day spa was exceptional.Highly recommend.",4
958,Old colonial building,5
959,"I was arriving early morning. To make sure that I do not encounter answer like: check in time is after 2 my room was paid from day before... well it was not ready! Of course I protested and made sure they read the reservation again. It took over an hour to clarify that. Honestly it should not happen. Then I was given far inferior room with dirty windows overlooking parking, for a short period. I moved to my room early afternoon. They should take off one night from my bill at least for that kind of service!!!! NO, they did not! So not such a great experience. I could stay in Shangrila just across where I have high status, I loved the look of the Galle Face...",2
960,"Bathroom is good, great water pressure. Great food and dining. Beds great. Itâs a lovely hotel.",5
961,We had to move a lot as we wanted and paid for 2 rooms which were not provided.. took a while to get the correct rooms.,3
962,"We had a spacious comfortable room. The restaurant on the verandah serves varied buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner. At sunset, the flag is lowered by an official accompanied by a bagpipe player in kilt. Good salt-water pool.",4
963,"We really loved our stay, in particular the decor and the ambience! Perfect location as well!! The breakfast was simply delicious! Very nice also the entrance and the first floor common areas!! Relaxing and fully of charme!",5
964,"The room was quite small, but this was part of the charme and we do not see it as a negative point! We would definitely come back!",4
965,"Large room and bathroom,very clean.No terras but the window can be opened. Staff very friendly. Beautiful spa, not cheap.",4
966,Swimming pool is with salt water.,5
967,"I knew this was a hotel with a reputation but I genuinely didn't expect to be as blown away by it as I was. Gorgeous, grand place. We tried the seafood restaurant and it was lovely. A holy day so no alcohol design at the bar but still a glorious place. If you have the ability walk up and down the stairs rather than use the lifts. Even the atrium areas are amazing!",5
968,Nothing!,5
969,The communal rooms were great...fantastic old colonial feel. Our room had a great view.,4
970,The lighting was rather dim and the towels etc in the bathroom in short supply...,3
971,Overrated.  A very old hotel that does a poor job with soundproofing. Woke up when someone above my room started his morning prayers with a loud speaker.,1
972,The room is very comfortable and the complementary mini bar facility we enjoyed. Breakfast had a vast spread of food and delicious. Hotel staff is friendly and supportive.,5
973,The pool has no shallow end so a person who can't swim better can't enjoy the salt water pool. No view from the room.,5
974,"Great location and the service was friendly if slightly slow. My big comment was that we ate at 3 restaurants, the Verandah, the Sea Spray and 1864. The Verandah and Sea Spray were excellent, see below for the 1864.",4
975,"1864 was poor actually. Service was fine although it took an age for the wine to arrive as they had to get it from Sea Spray, but the food was far too western in a country with so much wonderful food. It was also empty on a Saturday night probably because of that.",3
976,Lovely room (in spite of being street-side (still not too noisy). Excellent fish restaurant (Sea Spray) looking over Indian Ocean) British Raj-type architecture  in wonderful setting.,5
977,"Staff (especially at buffet restaurant in evening) slow and lacked a welcoming smile (otherwise the key feature of Sri Lankan hospitality). Had problems and delays with correct billing for what we ate (nobody explained the computer was down!) ...not the best experience in our jetlagged state, so sadly we were left feeling the ""raj experience"" was a bit wanting.",2
978,"The room (2044) was big and comfortable. It included breakfast and evening drinks + canapÃ©s in the Long Room; very quiet with personal service. Food was excellent. The hotel itself is a classic example of British colonial architecture, a welcome change from the usual 5-star places.",5
979,Pool a bit small; limited space which could get crowded.,4
980,"A lovely old colonial building, directly on the ocean.We loved sitting in the garden, watching the sunset.Food was excellent and very tasty, the SPA area a bit too coldbut worth a visit. Go and see the little museum.",4
981,"A horrible construction zone is spoiling the view. Investors are building an island  right infront of Galle Face, call it Harbour city, with skyscrapers, Dubai style for many people. It is very very sad and will destroy the charme of the whole area.",3
982,"Really excellent service, fantastic breakfast!",5
983,"Not the hotelâs fault...I feel sad  that there is a huge construction project underway, north of Galle Face Green. It doesnât spoil the sunset view and some people who love building things will be fascinated, but it is constrast with this lovely hotel!",5
984,"The hotel is very classic - colonial style but the rooms are well furnished and modern. We received a free upgrade to a suite, which was fantastic. The breakfast buffet has a nice spread of Western and local fare.",5
985,Milk Toffee on Arrival was a very nice touch.  The in house museum and library gave a great sense of history of the hotel along with the painting and photographs of the hotel in its past glory.  The Breakfast buffet was amazing.  The Lo'ocitane spa was fabulous!  In particular the  grounds facing west are a great spot for a drink whilst watching the sun go down.,5
986,"On check in we were told our room would be affected by noise.  when we requested to be relocated they were quite reluctant to do so, but in the end accommodated our request.  A very minor blemish on what was a great stay.",4
987,Colonial style. Location - listening to the waves break enjoying a drink/dinner. Excellent level of service. Sea Spray restaurant - great venue and great food.,5
988,Hotel can feel a bit tired - but it is part of its colonial charm and heritage.,3
989,"The room was perfect, with an amazing view to the sea and sunset, a very comfortable bed, and a lovely bathroom. The swimming pool is beautiful - cool salt water.",5
990,"It was wonderful to live in a museum for 2 days. It looks amazing in the lobby, restaurants, library,  and the museum.",5
991,"Unfortunately our room (4006) was a disappointment, the light was very unpleasant, the bathroom needs an urgent renovation (smells like mold), and the towels are grey instead of white.",2
992,It's not like a modern 5 star but it is well compensated by its caracter. Good breakfast but average coffe. High tea was excellent.,4
993,Not enough sun chairs at the pool. Only one hanger for bath towels is a bit annoying.,4
994,Fabulous and personalized attention. The hotel has a lovely view of the Indian Ocean with really nice sunsers. In the restaurant  they serve a buffet with different types of food every day. Always delicious.,5
995,I liked everything.,5
996,"Great location with stunning views, and nice food. ",5
997,"2 small things: Limited activities - which suited us, to be fair - and there were a lot of staff just sort of loitering around, which was mildly off-putting. 
",3
998,Beautiful colonial building with wonderful sea views. Staff very friendly and the 1864 hotel restaurant was fantastic - best steak we've had in months.,5
999,The service could be very slow at times and the little touches you expect from a five star hotel were missing.,4
1000,"This is simply a great hotel. It is old - 1860s -  but beautifully renovated. It is right on the ocean front and a 15-20 walk to the Fort area of Colombo. The seafood restaurant is superb. Great service, large comfortable and clean rooms, excellent public area inside and outside. Why stay in other hotels that cost as much or more when you get such character at the Galle Face.",4
