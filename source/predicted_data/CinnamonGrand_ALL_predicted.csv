4,"Came for a honeymoon November last year, trying to figure out where to go for our next holiday together and realised all the answers were in sri lanka again! See our review from December 2018.,We both missed the unique experience of Cinnamon Grand so much that we came back for our first holiday of 2019 - service, hospitality and quality is exceptional as always. Special mention to: Leeza, Asanka and Prabath, have made our first day after a long flight as perfect as it can be. Incredible people and very much looking forward to seeing them and the rest of the team for the remainder of the stay. ,We spent every night at the Shisha Lounge in November and plan to do the same for this stay. Very happy to see Priyadanshana and Chadika again - the shisha they make is exceptional and couldn't be recommended any more highly. Their customer service is unbelievable and they make us feel at home again.,Here's hoping that time goes as slowly as possible for the next 8 nights.,Much love to the whole cinnamon grand team! ",5

27,"Whilst the hotel is definitely luxurious, I can't get myself to give it more than a 3 for the following reasons:,1. Overpriced - our total nightly rate was extortionate purely because they charge more than 30% taxes on top of the rate,2. The electrical sockets aren't distributed properly in the rooms so to charge anything is also a nightmare ,3. We didn't feel like it was good value for money,Otherwise it's a great hotel but I just don't think it's worth what we spent on it.",3
28,The Food is Commendable to thr place and Music. Loved every Bit of IT. The Staff is verry friendly and thr service was fast and efficient. The Band is playing music according to thr Crowd.

Particularly, Sanjeewa, Danushka, Shirath, who were so kind to our son and helped to make our stay so memorable! Thank you.",5
33,"I stayed recently for five nights on business. ,The location is great...one block from the water and close to the interesting Galle Park. ,Check in was very attentive. I was looked after by all manner of staff and worried that I was expected to be handing out tips (and had no Sri Lankan currency as yet). ,The public areas are pleasant, albeit fairly busy and often the seating areas were all occupied. It's also pretty brightly lit, seemingly day and night, although that is likely a personal taste thing. ,The room was large and well appointed. Everything was clean and everything I used was replaced the next day. There also was a turn down service. It was all most comfortable. ,The breakfast was very impressive. Lots of choice and all very pleasant, although always very busy when I was there. ,The executive floor was super with most excellent and attentive service. ,The pool area was good and the bar service there was of a high standard. Jackdaws were a bit of a problem, despite the staff's best efforts. ,I ate in a couple of the restaurants in the evenings and had good food and good service consistently.",4

It is however rumoured that this hotel has been sold and will be converted into a hospital. If this is true,its sad. We have stayed here on our 3 prior visits and would not stay anywhere else.",5
38,Staying at the Cinnamon Grand is wonderful but you can also just stop by  for a coffee and short  eat or a fabulous sweet treat while listening to the grand piano. It is a  very tranquil stop as you are sightseeing  down a Galle Road. They serve the best cappuccino in town and at a great price,5
39,"I am now at the hospitality lounge in the hotel.  Took a shower and wait for my midnight flight back home.  The lounge is clean, tidy and all necessities are available.   This arrangement is so thoughtful.  After a long hot day visit in Colombo, it feels so great to have a shower before the flight",4

60,"During the 3 weeks we travelled in Sri Lanka we spent 4 nights at this hotel at two different times. We initially chose it because of the opportunity to eat ""in-house"" at a large variety of restaurants/cafes without the need to venture out of the hotel. The hotel is what you would expect of a 5 star establishment re service, rooms etc but certainly the pool and restaurants we ate in were excellent. The buffet breakfast is something to behold - so many choices, go for the egg hoppers, yum - nothing wrong with a good dose of chilli to get the morning started! We had dinner twice at Lagoon, all about beautifully cooked very fresh seafood and once at Tao. I thought this was more of a Japanese cuisine but I'd describe it as general Asian - delicious and the outdoor setting was delightful. A great base while in Colombo.",4
61,"Had a delicious meal at Tao restaurant. Seats overlooking the water features and overall lovely ambience. Dilani who served us, gave a great recommendation on the food and was friendly and attentative throughout the meal. Highly recommend if visiting Colombo.",4
62,We had a wonderful meal in Chutneys restaurant. The food was superb and this was definitely enhanced by the friendly and helpful service of Sam (our waiter). He politely guided us through the menu and advised us which dishes may suit our taste. His suggestions were spot on and it was so good to try different curries too. If in doubt ...ask for Sam!,4

75,"As always I enjoyed staying at this hotel.  Conveniently located for business travelers.  The hotel is very lively and has several options to dine. The room is spacious and clean. The only problem this time I found is though the room was non smoking,  the smell was there in the room and also on the corridor.  Hope they do something about it because as a non-smoker, I found the smell not very pleasant. Other than that I would rate this hotel very high. ",4
76,"Charming resturant never to miss . Very calming environment to chill out with nice beer. Hidden place in the city but well recognized I guess. Food is ok but the service is comparely outstanding. Dilani was very knowledgeable,and should thankher for welcoming service",5

81,"Always known for some of the best cakes in the city, did a delightful surprise in making a custom birthday cake. Almost limitlessly accommodating Chef. ARUNA with his amazing insight & attention to detail made a unique five-layered french cake with each layer representing an exotic flavor, finished off with a flowery tropical outlook. Surprisingly affordable overall, contrary to popular belief. ,  Coffee shop Ship-leader DIAN with his warm & enthusiastic willingness to 'walk-that-extra-mile' to find the best professionals for the project made all the difference.  If you'll ever happen to be at the 'Coffee Stop' for a such a need, look for DIAN & Chef ARUNA. You'll never be disappointed.  ,-Dr. Rajitha",5
82,"Of all the hotels I have gone to this has been the only place where the front desk staff had no idea about their hotel. One of your staff members ""Thamara"" had no idea which direction I had to take in order for me to go to my room. I had to wait for 15 minutes with my heavy back pack until she finally showed me the way which was already too late for her because I asked one of the bus boys. I gave her another chance and asked where Taprobane was. All she gave me was a blank face which clearly explained that either she had no idea what language I was speaking or again she had no idea how I should go there. I was told that cinnamon grand hotel had an impeccable staff who knew what information they have to give from A to Z but clearly this shows that this fact is false! Time wasting and blank faces don't help a hotel especially a hotel such as yours. I hope that you don't allow this time wasting experience to repeat itself once again to another visitor.",1
83,"I stayed here for one night during a business trip.  I use a wheelchair but found moving around all areas of the hotel easy.  The staff are very polite, friendly and helpful.  Special thanks to the lobby manager Brian Regginalld.",5

86,It was nice service by her impressed tomvisit agin. Nice service plus the nice food. Should try this we will surely come again. Nice try. The best chinese resturant must be. Thank for her service. Thanks,5
87,"I continue to come back to this hotel because it is stylish, well located, with great service and a feeling of luxury. The Taprobane restaurant has been updated and the breakfast buffet is great. An egg hopper in the morning is a great way to start the Sri Lankan day. ,The lobby is elegant and sophisticated. People keep stopping by the beautiful fountain in the center to take selfies. The piano music really makes the place feel like a central meeting place. ,Between my work meetings i had a few hours each day to grab a coffee in the lobby coffee shop. It is a place to watch Colombo's beautiful people as they sip their drinks in the glow of the evening sun shining through the skylight. Every day, I was welcomed by Mr. Malith and Mr. Nilupul who asked ""How was your day?"" and ""Today, you should treat yourself!"" Friendly and effective salesmen, and perfect hosts! This is why I come back to the Cinnamon Grand each time!  ,The rooms are great and comfortable. But this time I spent more time by the pool to enjoy the warm air and the cool water. Too bad work gets in the way!",5
88,Had a very stressfulday & came for a dinner to Tao Chineese Restaurant. Saw very friendly person Mr. Priyadarshana at Cinnamon Grand Shisha bar & he served a very quality & fantastic shisha & made my weekend night awesome. Would really recommend for all my forign & local friends to visit Cinnamon Grand for there stay as well as to try best shisha in heart of colombo from Priyadarshana in Cinnamon Grand shisha lounge. ,5
89,"Cinnamon Grand was our first stop in a two week tour of Srilanka. After a long flight from Australia (several hour delay in Singapore) our check-in was seamless and the room delightful. The nightly turndown service was greatly appreciated, especially the touch of tea and chocolates. The food at breakfast was delicious, but as we were in Colombo for only one day we didnât sample any of the hotelâs tempting restaurants. Only regret is that we hadnât booked any other Cinnamon hotel during our trip. We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5
90,"I have been coming to this hotel for many years and everything from the staff, management and cuisine is amazing. The staff are humble and friendly always greeting you with a huge Sri Lankan smile!,The fantastic array and variety of exotic food produced by chefs here leave Michelin star chefs in Europe way way behind.,Well done and Thank YOU.",5

102,"Stayed at the hotel on 5th January 2019 with family. Nice hotel, quite big, very croweded. The loby actually resembles a nicely decorated public place :-) Good location, but not on the sea. Rooms are small (  common for all city based hotels ), but nicely decorated and maintained. Didn't had any food at the hotel as there are so many eating joints nearby like Ministrty of Crab etc. and so can not comment on the restaurants. The banquet is at the middle under a dome and the floors are on a circular formation keeping the banquet at the centre. So you get a good view of people dancing and performing from above as if you are seeing it from a gallery :-)) ,Good experience alltogether.",3
103,"We had a short stop over in Colombo, and chose nice hotel finalize the great holiday. The hotel was really nice and beautiful, staff was really nice and helpful, altough we had our tourist clothes on, last clean ones (most visitors wore suit :D ),The italian restaurant was really good and the service spectacular, food exellent.,Only thing to comlain was the upstair pool area, which is quite outdated, and the jacuzzi is couple bubbles from the wall. ,Would visit again, maybe couple night next time to just enjoy the facilities",4
104,This is my 3rd time at Cinnamon Grand Colombo. Outstanding property in the heart of Colombo. Breakfast and food is superb. Only 5 minutes walk from sea and 15 minutes from Marine Drive (for more Sri Lankan Food Options).,4
105,"I recommend this shisha bar i like the service of Priyadarshana and the other crew alao  they are very helpful and kind thank you so much , the taste of shisha , atmosphere and the view of relaxing pool",5

107,"Shisha bar is a amazing place to have a shisha. We had some food and mocktails. It was amazing. Priyadarshana,Fahad and manager Upali. They are awesome. Nice atmosphere. Highly recommended this place. We are coming again and again because of priyadarshana and fahad.",5
108,Nugagama had an authentic village feel in the middle of the city. Every detail was considered down to the napkins. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Mondayâs are extra special as there are traditional dancers and musical performances.,5
109,"We had a great time at the shisha bar , service was excellent and staff were friendly and helpful and amazing ,, shisha and tea were nice,,special thanks to Mr priyadarhana who was super nice with a lovely smile at all time ,, thank you again",5
110,"Very nice hotel. The rooms are bid and airy. Food was very good and a varied variety. We had a room that overlooked a park where they were holding a contest, but it finished at 11pm and was not an issue. Even the air con which was on all night was fairly quiet",4
111,"We came for dinner to Chutneys during our honeymoon. Our waiter Sam was kind, efficient & helpful. He helped us decide what to order, we told him the flavours and spices we liked and he made excellent recommendations. He came to check throughout our meal if we were happy.,Best Indian food we have had. Would recommend! Thanks Sam!",5

116,Excellent ambience and staff the food is great. Helpful and friendly service. I would recommend my friends to visit the Restuarant. The sports bar is great. You can sit and have a drink and watch cricket and soccer,5
117,"Superb hotel situated heart of Colombo close to all amenities. Spacious, clean and luxurious rooms with modern comforts. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Best thing is the number of restaurants it has. You have a range of cuisine options from Sri Lankan to sea food to international. I tried Nuga gama the traditional Sri Lankan restaurant and Lagoon seafood restaurant which were awesome with heaps of options. Extremely satisfied with the stay. Highly recommend !",5
118,I gotta say that cheers pub is my favorite bar in colombo. It's perfect for any occasion. The staff is very friendly and helpful . I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The bartenders here make some of the best cocktails so try it out ,4
119,"Nasitha and dilani were very good. The place serves excellent Chinese food. Enjoyed the hospitality.,Keep it up ,Good work guys we will be definitely visiting again  .nice food to taste and the atmosphere is fantastic",4

121,"Dilani is an excellent host. She is warm , friendly and courteous. Being multi-lingual she reaches out to your diverse clientele with ease . Good staff is difficult to get. Hold on to her like gold dust.",4
122,"While the atrium wing which houses the hotel rooms is strangely dark (for an atrium), the rooms are bright, very well appointed and impressively clean. The pool area is quite nice too and the pool bar is a lovely and breezy indoor/outdoor bar. However, service there was a bit slow and I received possibly the worst burger I've had in years. (But, hey, that's what I get for ordering a burger in Sri Lanka in the first place, I know, I know.)",4
123,The service provided by Mr. Roshan and Mr. Nuwan is simply amazing with smile on their face and providing exactly what I was looking for .. they are the best staff I have ever been served by . Love the services ,5

126,"Stayed for 2 nights. Great service at check-in and checkout. A range of restaurants ,nuga guma was a great experience and the staff were very efficient and friendly. Recommended! Great clean rooms and plenty of in-room amenties. The food at the wedding was also delicious.",5
127,"We were guests at the hotel for 3 nights.  Of the 7 hotels we stayed in during our 3 weeks in Sri Lanka, this was indeed the most grand.,Check-in was very good and the multiple staff welcoming us very cordial.,We were located in the older wing of the hotel, which we were advised was once a Taj property.  It was understated but immaculately clean. That end of the property is extremely quiet. In fact, as one walks the corridors, it appears deserted. ,Our only complaint with the room is that the selection of English channels was limited compared to some other hotels where we stayed. ,Our included breakfast at the Taprobane was most disappointing. I will review that later. We also ate at Noodles (to be reviewed), Nuga Gama (reviewed) and spent many hours in the tea lounge (to be reviewed.),The hotel's location is ideal. ,Check-out was exemplary and our bill was in order.",4
128,"We came to this restaurant two times.,The buffet was amazing.,Autentic and a big selection of Sri Lankan food.,The waiter Wasalage and Dhananjaya are very courteous and nice guys. ,Also the manager Ruwan is amazing and we talked with them about the country.,In our oppinion the best restaurant in Colombo.",4
129,Try to find Saldin and Stanislaus as they will assist you with what you need at the lounge. Very good service and very accomodating. Did not encounter any issues during my stay at the lounge... The foods were OK...,4
130,"Excellent hotel. Highly recommended hotel in Sri Lanka. Lounge is very nice, very professional staff and crew. Food is excellent, too. Very hospitable personnel. I will definitelt come back in this hotel. Curator stanislaus and saldin . Thank you very much!!!! See you again!",5
131,"From the moment one is welcomed by the doorman one feels at home . Although a large hotel , the staff soon make you feel like an honoured guest . From the smiling staff at the superb breakfast buffet, to each of the 14 restaurants, one is welcomed by smiling faces . The reception desk is staffed by those who speak fluent English, and Amanda checked me in , and each day was very helpful in making arrangements for me . The Concierge Chandimal saw to it that my iPad was recharged through the night and ready for collection first thing in the morning. My bedroom was well furnished , beautifully clean , and I liked the fact that chocolates are left every evening on the coffee table .",5
132,"5 star hotel, but not a 5 star experience. At arrival all was good, but after check in, things was not what we hoped for. The breakfast was total caos. The staff was running, the tables did not get cleaned, there where no glasses when we went to get drinks, we had to ask and look around for staff to bring coffee. The breaksfast area was all to small for this hotel and we felt that the hole breakfast was stressfull. We where really looking forward to a nice 5 star breakfast. The rooms was ok, we had a premium room. The rooms are getting a little old, but the bed was really good and the housekeeping looks after you. Nice pool area as well. To sum it up, we felt that it not was worth 5 stars, but still a good and really big hotel with many restaurants to choose from.",3
133,"We selected Taprobane Restaurant when my wife and I hosted our good friend from the University of Bath of UK, when he visited our Department of Civil Engineering of University of Moratuwa as the external examiner.  We were there for dinner and the variety of food available was amazing and it included all kinds of Eastern, Japanese, Western, etc.  It was all wonderful food with no limit, but all at a fixed price of less than US $ 20 per person.  We enjoyed it all very much and the variety of desserts was also wonderful.   I am sure this is one of the best restaurants in Colombo for any visitor looking for a very good meal after a full day of sight seeing.",4
134,"One of the best ambiances I have seen , most friendly staff and food .... out of this world. Real taste of Lanka. Mangala , Ruwan , Isara , Dananjaya well done and keep up the good work. ,Not forgetting lovely live music. I would come back for sure and must bring my friends along ",5
135,"Had a comfortable and pleasant stay at the hotel. Hotel was excellent with outstanding facilities, very centrally situated. Nilantha, Sajeeva, Upul, ladies at the desk and Dashendra at the restaurant provided us with excellent service.",5
136,"Recently I stayed at Cinnamon Grand hotel, Colombo for two nights on a business trip. Location was very central. Felt like hotel has not changed for quite some time. ,Staff is very friendly, however could do with bit more attention to guests specially during brakefast buffet and at the Cheers Pub.,Facilities are grate at the hotel, got so many restaurants, swimming pool, ect. ",3
137,"From the time  Cinnamon Grand opened in 1975 (then the Hotel Lanka Oberoi) this has been the best Hotel in Colombo. After it became Cinnamon Grand the place reflects warmth, a nice place for get togethers, family reunions or just chilling! It also has everything needed for guests in close proximity with the Crestcat Mall on the same premises. I highly recommend the Cinnamon Grand Hotel.",4
138,This is one of the best places to hang out. Shisha bar is awesome if you wanna hang out and chill with your buddies on a weekend. The atmosphere is serene and cozy with warm music that will set the mood for a great evening. Definite try out spot. Highly recommend Priyadarshanaâs warm hospitality.,5
139,"We arrived and were told we'd been upgraded to a superior room. If that's the case I'd hate to stay in a standard room. It was small, tired and the bathroom needed a complete refit. Overall the hotel is noisy, impersonal and more sutiable for business/weddings. The pool is small. Staff very helpful. I remember this hotel when it was the Oberoi and THE place to stay in Colombo... today it is a far cry from its heyday.,Cheers pub in the basement was dire. The main area that represents an ""authentic English pub"" is given over to the smoking area so those who do not smoke are seated in what is effectively a corridor and an ante-room - and the smoke is all pervading. Staff great, food poor.",2
140,"We came from Saudi for a five day break and found the hotel stunning. We have written the restaurant reviews separately but overall the food was excellent. We recommend that you book in the renovated part of the hotel as the bathroom has higher pedestals (my wife has a titanium knee) and the hotel were able to move us-thank you. ,We had a great trip with the Cinnamon Ranger, Nishantha, to the Elephant Orphanage, Botanic Gardens and Temple of the Tooth (separate reviews) and would recommend him for a day out.,There was a huge variety of live music and easy access through an adjacent mall to reasonably priced tuk-tuks. We also had a pool day and overall had a really enjoyable stay.",5
141,"We stayed here two nights. Good sized standard room, clean and well appointed. Free bottled water and a wide selection of amenities in the room. Lovely pool. Large breakfast buffet. Some of the reception staff were a little in under trained, for example not knowing where the hotel was on one of their local area maps. Otherwise good.",4
142,I wanted to have really nice Peking duck in Colombo but wasnt sure if they sure authentic ones. But have to admit Tao Resturant made my expectation true. Dilani suggested go with skin as starters and try the meat as suzzliling duck dish.,5
143,The hotel was great. I went for an event which we hosted in a restaurant there. The Food was awesome. We had a great spread of seafood delicacies. Even the deserts were yummy. The event was based on a Single malt and Cigar evening. The bar where we held the event had great service and served the guests very well.,5
144,"We had our executive board meeting in Angsana and it was a great experience. The team at the banquets Mahesh, Chathuranga & Karen were very supportive and helpful. They were available throughout the meeting and it was easy to reach out to them. Very friendly and active staff. Thank you guys. You made the day very pleasant. Keep up the good work.",5
145,"Ive been here many times ,I love the atmosphÃ¨re and the shisha, the food je also great and they have LIVE BAR BANDS NIGHTS also the  staff are so amazing and friendly specially my friand Priyadarshana look for him he is the BEST",5
146,"Very nice environment, peaceful and enjoyable. Also food are fabulous specially mutton and crab curry and very happy with service provided by staff. Also chef personally attended for our additional food requirement",4
147,"Large and impersonal, on a very busy road and appended by a large an uninspiring shopping mall, this is not a place I would recommend as a great holiday experience/destination. That said, as a stopover for one night before travelling on, the room was large and comfortable and made for a good rest. ",4
148,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at Grand Cinnamon. The hotel caters for all from authentic Srilankan cuisine to the best coffee shop with a wide variety of snacks and homemade cakes! The dÃ©cor and ambience at the Jaffna festival was amazing and something I highly recommend to experience as it has native dances and food- takes place in February every year. The lagoon seafood restaurant is a must try, we really enjoyed the spices used to prepare the aromatic and tasty food!,We initially has issues with our booking, no fault of the hotel, but the hotel manager and staff took it upon themselves to resolve the issue swiftly. Special thank you to Yasangika Samaranayake for following up with the booking issue and making our stay at the hotel comfortable.",5
149,"Very satisfied dinner in this restaurant. ,Servers kinded, dish was perfect. ,My father said it was verrrry good. Soo satisfying food and welcoming hospitality. Happy to come in our next visit in srilanka.",5

152,Breeze bar is fantastic place to visit with friends and chill out. Got a great service from Priyadarshana. We had mocktais and french fries. Food is amazing and reasonable. I highly Recommend to people who like to relax.,5
153,"Came here for business and staying at this property for the first time and one word. WOW.  ,From checking in to my room, seamless. The car picked me up at the airport and delivered me to the front door, where I was whisked to my room with amazing amenities and the best bed ever. ,Then to the executive lounge the service, food and beverages are awesome. And the staff best trained and polite that I have ever met. ,From Cheers Bar and Restaurant to the other 13 restaurants outstanding service. ,Even my butler who personally asked if I had laundry it is a joy. ,I was taken to a Jaffna food festival in the garden that transported you to a real village with singing, dancing and fabulous local food. ,So if you are in the region or the Maldives please consider the Cinnamon Group of hotels and resorts for an experience you will never ever forget. ,10 stars for the Cinnamon Group out of 5. Please develop more hotels. ",5

158,"Nothing grand about this hotel at all. This hotel is old and has probably seen better days. Quite disappointing given its TripAdvisor ranking. I'm guessing the ranking was built up back in the day when there was far less competition, but there are much better and more modern options now for the same price.",3
159,No wonder this is rated as the best Chinese resturant in Colombo. Food is average yet the service is very satisfying. Can expect us visiting here again.. Delani was superb in her nice service. It was grear,4
160,"I had visited Tao for my anniversary. My spouse being a vegetarian had great options to choose from and the food was delicious. They took extra care to make sure that she was served properly as per her dietary requirements. ,I had some dim sums, duck and pork and they were all excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.",5

163,"I really wanna to thankful all the staff special the shisha bar man  priyadarshana,For his hospitality and his service really he was very fast and we was more than satisfied   And inshalah we  will back there soon ",4
164,"We decided to spend a few hours at the cinnamon grand and have some drinks and lunch, we then decided that we would have a dip in the pool as it was quite hot and we ended up having lots of cocktails before and after lunch. Extremely dissapointed that we were charged RP 2500 ( approx $20AUD) per person for a quick dip ( was super quick as although the water looked inviting it was absolutely freezing so we would have been in the pool for a maximum of 10mins) we did tell the staff memeber we were just checking to see if the water was warm and was told that no we had to pay first before we could dip our feet in. Happy to pay to use the pool as we did this at many of the resorts in srilanka but have never been charged more than about $8AUD! I think this was an absolute rip off, given that we spent over $900AUD for lunch and drinks for our party of 8.",1
165,We have been coming here all the time.they give us high quality service.and also classy service they give Iâm happy all the time to dine here specially I need to mention Hashi giving great service assisting me with a smile and also lolita eranga and channa giving me a quality service ,5

We organised a conference for about 50 people at the hotel and the function went seamlessly- the events team were great and always on call for our requests, even late night. Planning the event was also very easy for us and there was support during our entire event- we never had to look for staff. Every request, no matter how strange it was was met. ,The rooms are clean, comfortable and luxurious. Housekeeping was also cheerful and great!. Hotel food was also great. All in all, we went on a work trip but felt like a holiday between the spa, pool and service! I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for both the work and leisure traveller. Its also well located and you can walk to some of Colombo's best sites!  Service at its BEST!",5

During our wonderful time with him he was flexible to our wishes and recognised what was best for us. He gave us his knowledge and advice willingly without being pushy. Nishanthaâs knowledge of the wildlife was incredible, he helped two people not familiar with birds spot a Serpent Eagle from 100yds. He was also keen to help us in our understanding of the welfare of the animals. ,Thank you Nishantha! ",5

186,"Last year, within 24 hours of arriving in Sri Lanka, I found myself in the hospital needing emergency surgery.  The staff at the Cinnamon Grand took care of me to a level I would never have imagined.  A few weeks ago, I returned for the first time since that trip, and I have to say the experience of the hotel and the kindness of the staff did not disappoint at all.  Jeremy, the concierge who had taken me to the hospital last year and did the paperwork for me while I waited for the doctor, called me shortly after I got to my room last month just to welcome me to the hotel.  It was his birthday but he made a point to make sure I was comfortable and satisfied.  The next day, I got to meet his family and thank him in person.  I also received a welcome call from Nilantha, the other concierge who had looked after me last year on my second trip to the hospital.  He, like Jeremy, went out of his way to make sure I enjoyed my stay.  I spend several hundred nights a year in hotels, but no hotel has captured my heart the way the Cinnamon Grand has -- it simply has everything -- rooms, restaurants, facilities, and staff -- at the highest level.  The service, though, stands out to me as being truly exceptional.",5
187,Very good setup and Lovely food. Well organized by the hotel staff. Enjoyed the Jaffna culture dance. Jaffna Toddy was the best. I recommend this for anyone who like Jaffna food. Mangala is selling the best Jaffna attack.  We can purchase bottles and take to our country back,5
188,"Had dinner with the family at the Jaffna festival that was held at the Nuga sevena that day ,And decided to have coffee and a some snacks at the lobby bar.The staff on duty was the least helpful staff we had ever met at cinnamon Grand .The new rule that no food will be served after midnight at the lobby bar gives late night customers no reason to visit the hotel at all considering the fact that even the staff are not too keen to serve or help in anyway.",5
189,"Iâm a regular visitor to Colombo and wouldnât stay anywhere else. Thereâs been a lot of new 5-star options arrive in the market in the past few years and Iâve sampled a few, but for service and friendliness remain miles off the cg. I stay on the exec floor and itâs always worth it; the friendliness and care extended to me is unsurpassed anywhere else Iâve stayed in the world. Congratulations guys - can i especially mention the exec floor staff at desk, butlers and lounge staff; all remarkable. Thankyou - Carl",5

196,We stayed here for two nights at the start of our Sri Lankan holiday. Very central location for sight seeing (about 45 mins from the airport). The pool area was lovely for an afternoon swim and we had a fabulous foot massage at the mall connected to the hotel (lucky it was connected as there was a huge downpour that afternoon). Also at the mall were ATMâs and a supermarket. The rooms were interconnected and beautifully appointed with everything our family of 4 needed. Staff were friendly and helpful and we had a fabulous dinner at Tao restaurant and enjoyed the breakfast buffet. Would definitely stay again. ,5

198,"Lovely hotel with white glove service and well appointed rooms featuring good views, quiet environment, in room WiFi, large closet, safe, turn down service and bathroom with tub and separate shower. This is definitely a convention hotel as it is enormous but the tower is quiet and the staff very friendly and accommodating. Dinner buffet was over the top with food stations from every part of the world. Even though the restaurant was full, servers were attentive and the wine selection good and reasonably priced. The hotel arranged car service to take us shopping a few miles away and then to the airport for much less than market price and in an air conditioned car with bottled water. They also arranged a late very check out at no additional cost. Both nights we were here there were large weddings but the hotel easily served guests and residents alike. It is a lovely property with beautiful pool and grounds. We enjoyed our stay. ",5

212,"In January 2019 I had the pleasure of staying at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo in an executive room with lounge access.  This was money very well spent! ,We entered a well appointed and clean room that overlooked the pool and with complementary wine on arrival. After a hot day being out and about in Colombo, it was lovely to return to room with fresh fruit and delicious chocolates with the nightly turndown service. ,Our stay included daily breakfast, high tea and happy hour in the executive lounge. ,The food range and quality was consistent, and most importantly accompanied with fantastic hospitality and service. It was loverly to be greeted on entry with smiles and shown to our table.  Little things like the staff remembering our coffee, tea and cocktail preferences and arranging for special breakfast, fruit or drink requests to be made available the next day added to the feeling of being indulged and spoilt. ,I can't wait for my next visit.",5
213,"We had a new setup today in Nuga Gama. Its was decorated with Jaffna theme. Its was a nice experience for our foreign friends from Estonia as well. We enjoyed the food of course. Also staff was very nice and courteous, specially Mangala, Dhananjaya, Herby, Sankha and Diseera. Thanks",5

217,"Hotel is really grand. And to add to it the Sri Lankan people are really sweet and joyous. Overall the location is adjoining the beach side which is nice to go walking. There is a small mall kinda thing in the basement or maybe adjoining the hotel if you don't feel like going far from the hotel. There are many multi cuisines restaurant serving Indian (south indian ), Chinese and Italian food as per my knowledge. The house keeping staff is very hospitable. The hotel accepts USD more than its own local currency but they do give good value of USD. Better to use USD over their local currency inside the hotel premises. Different kinds of tea at its best price and taste one can have in and around Colombo. You may also catch few marriages whilst your stay there as I did in my three days of stay twice hehehe.",4
218,"Best seafood restaurant in Srilanka. Quality Quantity and Price is unmatched by any other place.,Friendly staff specially Mr Ranjith and Chef Piyal.,Nice amibiance and very clean.,All the best for a nice future",5

220,"This 5 star hotel is well appointed and has a great big pool. However, it is so large and weirdly designed over 3 badly-linked buildings that we kept getting lost to get from our room to the garden or the restaurant. You have to change elevators and cross 2 vast lobbies bigger than football fields.,The breakfast spread is absolutely amazing. Never seen anything like it ! And they make hoppers on demand too.",4
221,"This is a very nice hotel Ã®n Colombo with kind people and very delicious food. Rooms are very clean, the breakfast Ã®s excelent with a various meals. The pool Ã®s also clean and big enough for enjoying it. Next time i ll visit SRI Lanka, i will for sure choose the same hotel. ",4

The curries were extremely tasty with a huge variety from crab and pork to fresh vegetable curries. The star of the show  however, were the hoppers. They were made to perfection and some of the best weâve tried in the city. ,Along with the great food, you also get to experience true Sri Lankan dancing and music. The talented team put on an unforgettable show that you wonât get anywhere else. ,Lastly, the staff were excellent. They greeted us with a smile and were extremely attentive throughout the night. I would definitely recommend putting Nagagama on the top of your list.",5

239,"As if my stay in Cinnamon Grand wasnât comfortable enough, with all my needs attended to, then came my experience at Nuga Gama. Place was amazing, you get treated to this traditional village vibe indeed making you feel back to Sri Lankan roots. The food was even more amazing, with a wide selection of signature Sri Lankan dishes. And the curry - I tried em all and I had to go back for seconds! My mouth might be burning from all the spice but I leave the place smiling and happy. Highly recommended!",5
240,"Hotel was ok. Rooms were a bit outdated and smelled a bit funny, probably from the moisture. Last night though I dined at the Italian restaurant, âEchoâ. Food was top class and curator Pardeep  did everything he could to make us feel like home. ",3
241,Food was amazing at a great price. Service was mi nirosh  Mr gayan quick and efficient. We ordered the laksa & Thai basil chicken noodle which came really fast and tasted yummy. Our favourite was the green mango salad. Do call ahead and book early if you are planning on coming on a weekend.,5

Please give this guy a raise!  :-),Also we had exemplary service from Malinda at the Chinese restaurant.  Our kids were so jet lagged that they fell asleep at the table, but Malinda made sure that the food we ordered was sent up to the room so that the kids could eat something if they woke up hungry. It was touching how much he was concerned about our kids.,In short, a beautiful hotel with great customer service!  Special shout out to Prince!! Bravo!",5
250,"The Cinnamon Grand is a big hotel in a convenient location in Colombo. You can walk to many sites, however you're better off to take a tuktuk because of the heat. Service was generally good. The breakfast spread was good with a lot of variety; there was excellent Sri Lankan food (hoppers, dosa, etc.). The rooms however were pretty basic and there was a loud event in the central court area when we were staying there.",4

I have not stayed at a better Hotel in a long while. The Hotel has 14 restaurants which provide a good selection of food.

I also would like to thank Asanka Director and Brian (Manager). They have always gone out of their way to ensure that my stay is unique and comfortable. Keep up the good work guys. ",5
261,"The ambiance, the customer service and the way they suggest food was just too perfect. If not for Channa (Restaurant Manager), i will never order a Crab for our table. He is the one who suggested to try it out. Which was heavenly. Thank you Lagoon and Channa for the amazing experience.",5
262,"We stayed at the Cinnamon Grand on the last days of our holiday having had a great experience at Cinnamon Red.  The two hotels are different in style but again the hotel delivered as promised.  We had picked the Grand as we wanted to be able to walk up to Galle Face for sunset but also have a shower and change before getting on our midnight flight home (and without having to pay for that night's accommodation).  The Cinnamon Grand gave us a late check out (till 6pm) free of charge and then allowed us to use the ""hospitality lounge"".  We had the lounge to ourselves which had a TV, couches, water and  a male and female bathroom with shower, towels and toiletries. Best late check out ever.  PS - I had happened on the existence of the hospitality lounge when I was searching their site and we had to ask for it to be opened to us but it was worth it and I wouldn't hesitate to ask.",5
263,"Wonderful out door and under an enormous banyan tree restaurant. Buffets are noon and evening and consist of authentic Sri Lankan food including delicious deserts. Every Monday night a cultural revue is presented. Excellent. The waiters and support staff are ever eager provide assistance and information. In particular are: Mangala, Nisal, Krimal. ,If ever in Colombo, check out the Cinnamon Grand.  ",4
264,"Landed in Colombo after long flight, very large atrium entrance, rather soulless, vast, impersonal, needed sat- nav to locate the lift, reception staff remote and unwelcoming, however bar and restaurant staff polite and accommodating. ,Rooms large and contained most requirements, bed very comfortable.,Felt like I was staying in an  airdrome.",4
265,"I organized a 21st Birthday party for my brother at Cheers Pub. A special mention to chef Kemin who assisted me on preparing the menu for 20 pax which all of us loved. And a big thanks to Romesh, Madura and Chef Senadira.",4
266,"We stayed one night at this nice hotel before we went back home. The service was good and the food was amazing. We celebrated new years eve here, and joined for the celebration arranged by the hotel. It was a really great experience.",5
267,One of the greatest hotel in colombo. Love this place because of welcoming atmosphere. Staff is really helpful & polite. Lagoon restaurant is highly recommended for sea food. Prices are reasonable. Excellent service in all times.,5
268,"Arrived a little fatigued at 0030, had to get a receptionist to come to us. When he did he was very nice and sent us off with bags to the seventh floor. Keys didnât work, gentleman with us said we could sort AM. I said for safety we needed a key,went back, came back, still didnât work. I went back to reception and got a change of room, which I insisted on doing ourself. Hotel is contemporary and staff great. Cheers bar is okay. On last night there was a sound outside the hotel or in it, like a light aircraft, as we were up at 230am I rang reception and it was stopped??? Seriously at these prices none of our experience should have happened.",3
269,"We stayed at both the Kingsbury (for new yearâs eve) and at the Cinnamon Grand at the end of our visit to Sri Lanka. The Kingsbury is a great hotel and its rooftop bar was perfect for the new yearâs eve fireworks, but the Cinnamon Grand was the prefect way to finish off our vacation. It is like a city within a city. It has 14 restaurants of all different types of food, plenty of bars and cafe areas, a fantastic breakfast buffet, a great pool area with bar, excellent general facilities, and very helpful staff. A special mention to Leeza Fernando who looked after us wonderfully throughout our stay. We had a hitch with our booking (our fault) and Leeza handled everything, and followed up with emails etc, and then went out of her way to help us when we arrived and left. A special thankyou from the Nolanâs and the the Flipoâs!",5
270,"Colombo can a busy hectic messy place. Coming to the Grand Cinnamon felt like a civilised oasis. It is a beautiful grand hotel. Our room are comfortable, but was on the small side. My young kids enjoyed the pool which was great size.,The negative that I must mention is that we had an issue with our booking where we booked and paid for a room for 2 adults and 2 kids. But when we got there there was only one queen bed. After many discussions with the staff at reception, they blamed the company that sold me the room for not making this clear and I ended up having to pay for an extra bed. I was certainly not happy about this.",4
271,"I do not normally write a review until I have left the hotel however, on this occasion the level of service has been such that I am completing this one prior to checking out. No task has been too small for the Guest Services and butler staff to assist me with. As I am here for work I have used the Cinnamon Lounge daily once again all the members of staff here were helpful including in their choices of Sri Lanka food to experience. The room was well equipped to my needs the bed for me especially comfortable. The only other area I used regularly was the gym which had more than sufficient equipment and very spacious. Finally there are too many names of the staff that have gone extra mile in excellent customer service to mention as it would fill this review. ,All on the executive floor team should be congratulated by their supervisors.,Tharaka, Salman, Indika and Mario have been especially of help.,I did also have the pleasure of speaking to the Asanka Fernando AVP rooms division. I have already booked my stay for next work assignment in Sri Lanka at this hotel. Thanks to all I apologies for not having all the names.",5
272,"visited with family an year after have given an excellent review. Simply couldn'd believe the drop in quality in food and drinks. all the food ordered were that of 3rd grade quality.,pictures will speak volumes. too disappointing to describe each item. ,the staff are extremely hospitable with a smile. Given that i am still fond of this property i suggest that is anyone is interested in getting an honest feedback may contact me.",4
273,Had a magnificent authentic Sri Lankan dinner at Nugagama followed by a drink at the Tea Lounge . Every thing about this hotel is just great including a young gentleman by the name of Fahim who was most helpful. Certainly stay here next time in Colombo. ,4

Prices at the many restaurants (coffee shop, international, Indian, Chinese, Thai) and pubs are very reasonable compared to other five star hotels in the city of Colombo. The welcoming doormen, especially Mr Dias, coffee stop staff should be commended. Praneeth at the Taprobane 24 hr restaurant is an asset to the institution a dn you'll be lucky to be served by him.

The reason we went there was to celebrate our anniversary. We had other plans for evening so we decided to visit thaprobane for breakfast. We were warmly welcomed and served a table without a delay. But It took about 30 minutes for them to bring a baby chair and that too we had to remind them. Cutlery wasnât on the table. Coffee/ tea was not served. No one was coming to pick the plates. It was a very busy day and I understand that. I always leave positive feed back here cos thaprobane is somewhere we visit to celebrate our special occasions. I was so disappointed that I found a hair in my milkrice. I informed the Stewart and he made the chef to come and talk to us. ,But after seeing that hair in my food I did not feel like eating anything. To be honest I could not enjoy my breakfast.

391,"Stay away from this dump!  This place was probably nice in the 80s. Itâs a complete dive these days. The staff is rude and will try to cheat you. They over charged me and checked me out my room before my reservation, yet still charged me. The room smelled musty, and was outdated. The restaurant for breakfast in the morning had dirty plates in the tables from the previous nights dinner. Sanitation is not a priority here. Plates and silverware were generally dirty. Housekeeping rinsed out my used coffee cup and put it back like it was new and clean. I would recommend the Shangrala or any hotel built this century over this dump.",1
392,"Stanislaus was absolutely amazing with his kind service, so inviting, always smiling and lovely. I would return back to Noodles at the Cinnamon Grand just because of him! Thank you very much Stanislaus :)",5

Room service is also very slow, while placing an order they will also for 20 minutes and than I have e to wait for atleast 60 minutes for delivery. Housekeeping is also not done properly and while checking out you have keep waiting for the bell boy for 20 minutes to pick your luggage. The biggest problem in this hotel you call reception or housekeeping or room service they don't answer your calls promptly you have to keep waiting. Duty manger is also not helpful at all ,Overall I would rate my stay as one of the worst  hotel experience wheareas ther are other good options in Colombo pleas avoid this hotel m surely not staying in this hotel ever again.",1

421,"I must definetly start with their hospitality. Even if the food is nice you need a relaxed atmosphere to eat. Chutneys delivered them both which can be  rarely seen. The food... simply extraodinary. They had spices from kelara to the humble kulfi. ,Their interior is very soothing with neutral colours that don't hurt the eye and letters from different south indian languages on the ceiling, Simple but extraordinary...",4

423,"Really lovely hotel, great reception/foyer staff, comfortable room.,The breakfast unfortunately went down hill after the weekend I'm afraid.  Food choice wonderful but everything was  luke- warm.   They need a better way of cooking the omelettes, poached and fried eggs maybe have some already ready , by the time they were cooked we'd almost given up. ,Also they should have dedicated staff re-setting tables, serving  the tea & coffee and filling up the food.  It took ages to get anyone to serve drinks quite disorganised I'm afraid.  There seem to be too many managers and not enough serving staff.  A shame really as everything else in the hotel, the other bars and restaurants perfect.",4
424,Really great hospitality. I thoroughly enjoyed my the food. Nice interior very soothing. The food was also served quick. Chutneys definitely has to be on the. To do list of Sri Lanka. Everything was simply great. Friendly waiters and they were thorough with their order. There was a wide range of possibilities from Kerala curries to kalkari briyani. I loved that they didnât have a timing limit in any of the curries. The food was served hot and they had a suitable portion of food. They also have a wide range of beverages from juices to fizzy drinks. Definitely a place to visit in Sri lanka,4
425,"The room was lovely and very comfortable. Unfortunately it was difficult to get served at breakfast with tea or coffee. The coffee shop has brilliant cakes, chocolates, and ices, and at a really good price. The Breeze Bar is also very pleasant and not overpriced. The tea lounge is a must do with the fabulous Walters Bay teas. Loved the whole experience. I'd happily stay there again.",5

515,"Good comfortable room. Very good food with plenty of choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner at the Taprobane restaurant. Excellent service from staff.",5
516,"I had higher expectations for a 5* hotel. The hotel probably requires renovation, as the price doesn't match the offer. I pay attention to things like slippers, shampoo and soap, and such small details, and they were unsatisfactory. The shower door did not close/latch properly, and water would flood the entire bathroom. The hotel is lacking in aesthetics when it comes to bathroom amenities. The gym is fully equipped and overlooks a nice green area, but the equipment was noticeably old. Out of the many restaurants, I tried Lagoon (Seafood), and it had a market feel. Whether that was deliberate or not, I can't tell for sure, but it didn't have a 5* hotel feel to it. Not faulting the cleanliness, but the waiting staff were so busy, it took 40 minutes for someone to explain how ordering food works around there. I would say, overall, it is a nice hotel, and the staff were very kind and helpful most of the time, but I'd rate it 4* instead of 5.",3
517,"This is an excellent hotel just off the Galle Face Road.      A brilliant swimming pool, nice restaurants and comfortable rooms await.     All of the services and facilities are excellent.",5

521,"Always a dependable and comfortable stay in Colombo. Central to everything and with great restaurants, if you choose to eat in the hotel. Rooms are good value for money (restaurants are  slightly expensive) and its a hotel that delivers exactly what one would expect of a large property like it.",4
522,"14 restaurants to chose from - no need to leave the complex! Lots of staff to look after you, nothing too much trouble: I went to plug my phone in and someone was there to offer to do it for me. I swatted a fly whilst sat in the reception area and registered someone had noticed me -  5 minutes later a ""fly swatter"" had been deployed! OTT but that's what you get for 5 stars.",1

The lobby scene is vibrant and active through the late night hours. There are 14 restaurants to choose from, all superb. The quality of the service is outstanding. The hotel staff are friendly and accommodating and always greet you with a smile on meeting you. I couldn't be more pleased with the service here and I will return.",5

531,"The restaurants are superb. Nuga Gama, the village in a forest clearing under a banyan tree, is worth a visit to Colombo on its own. It is a really lovely experience, an enormous range of curries, beautiful lighting, pleasant staff and a live combo playing nice local music.Tao, the Chinese restaurant, is also in a beautiful setting, with fish swimming in ponds around the restaurant. The service is superb; I unfortunately didn't get the names of the delightful and professional managers, but my waiter there twice (Nasitha) could not have been more helpful.The London Grill is an upmarket fine dining restaurant. I didn't feel the service or atmosphere were as good as the restaurants previously mentioned (the candles were not lit; when I asked about them I was told the wrong fuel had been delivered...), but the food was excellent.The room was comfortable and clean, and looked down onto the pool, where there was a very nice bar (Breeze Bar), which was handy day and night for snacks and cocktails.",4
532,"The concierge was horrible and in fact rruined my holiday and made it unlikely I'll return to Sri Lanka.  On checking in I mentioned to the extremely pleasant front desk woman (Leeza) that I needed to get train tickets and she said not to worry about it, the concierge would sort that out. I went to him half an hour later with my 1st 2nd and 3rd choice of tickets for either of two trains on a sheet of paper. He waved it away and said ""Oh no, I'd be on the phone for ages"" (he was busy with nothing else) as there would be confusion over what class seating I would require. I pointed out that everything was very clear on the piece of paper, but he said No, just go to the station ypourself, it's not far. When I got to the station I was told there were no tickets for the day I wanted, though \I could get a ticket back when I needed one. I later returned and bought the return ticket and after a lot of haggling paid a taxi driver over 80 US Doillars to drive me to my destination.(Ella). When I arrived in Ella after a very long drive, a young couple arrived at the same time as me and when I told them about my attempted ticket purchase they said the ticket staff at the station were so rude and unhelpful that they had gone back to their hotel and asked the concierge to help and he had got them tickets. What was really annoying was that not only did I have to pay $80 instead of about $5 for a train ticket, but - even worse - that the concierge was so rude and totally unhelpful.. On my return to Colombo (NOT staying at the Cinnamon Grand) I complained about the incident to a manager called Davina, who lamely said she'd look into it. I pointed out to her that the concierge (a middle-aged man) was hardly likely to admit he had behaved in this way",1
533,"The property is huge and adjacent to a Shopping Mall, very conveniently located. Reception staff extended our stay till 4 PM on the last day, without even any request from us.",4
534,Nothing as such,5

539,"Thought the Reception staff were fantastic - Prabash couldn't have been more helpful.  As this was the second time we had stayed at the Cinnamon Grand in a month, he remembered us and made sure that everything was perfect.  Loved the Pool Bar as I mentioned before....one of my favorite places 'East of Suez'.  The night we arrived went to use the hairdryer and it didn't work - housekeeping were there withing 5 minutes and the dryer was replaced - the next morning went to iron something and the iron didn't work - yet again Housekeeping were there within 5 minutes.....brilliant.",4
540,"Well, the breakfast service could be a little more 'switched on'.  The main staff seem to work extremely hard but the 'suits' seem to be lacking in overall control.  Repeatedly, items would be depleted and one would have to ask....would be lovely to have some fresh orange juice instead of cordial....competitors in Colombo all seem to offer same.....",3

Fantastic big trees that block most of the city and make you feel that you in an oasis somewhere... pool and the bar are a fantastic escape.   Compare it to bland rooftop exposed and windy pool areas elsewhere... families can stay down in the pool area all day if they wish and totally manned all the time.

We tried 6 of the14 restaurants and the food was good and service very good there.Staff makes or breaks a stay.

593,"Everything is like about Cinnamon Grand....food .staff. Location. Pool. Rooms.Firstly the greeting you get on arrival sure makes you feel they care.....Leeza checked us in and was so welcoming.Would certainly highly recommend this hotel to all my friends and family.",5
594,Nothing.....,5
595,"It was just great to be in Cinnamon grand, one of the finest place in Sri Lanka. The staff was amazingly friendly and helpful with excellent professional touch. My special compliments to Miss Irushi for all the assistance and help.  It was a lovely stay.",5
596,Everything was perfect,5
597,"The room, the service, the friendlynes",4
598,"The food - unprofessional prepared. in the Noodles Restaurant show kitchen chefs touch cooked / prepared food with bare fingers.Cooking and presentation is below any international standard. Taste very bad - the dishes are not authentic.",3
599,Leaving Cinamon Grand was my favourite part.,4
600,"It is a very old hotel, it seems royal but it is not. Smell of fish and dirty water surrounds the outside of the hotel, pool is not enjoyable. Our bed smelt like someone had peed in it and the room itself smelt old and dirty. The overall functionality of the room is poor too, no power connections; we only had 1 in the whole room. The toilet is cramped and dirty. Its not worth the money. Too expensive for a very poor quality that it offers.",1
601,"I liked the location and friendly staff.Breakfast was sumptuous and open till 1030.lively atmosphere in the lobby and happy hours between 7 and 8 pm on malt drinks.",4
602,"Need more trained staff during peak breakfast service, Place gets crowded and I felt the restaurant was understaffed. This is the first time I stayed with Cinnamon Grand, I normally stay at the Hilton. However, the service levels are comparable.",4
603,Average,3
604,"As Booking.com is one of your options for reservation of room for your clients like us. We haven't even know Grand Cinnamon hotel and got to know through booking.com. We would like to say for cancellation or add my reservation, property have the right to modify the bookings. Emergency situation visitors may needs to short or extend their stay. Your hotel couldn't provide any support after informing at the very begaining of the stay and finnaly my colleages needs to pay for four nights without staying rest two days as they needs to check out after two days. Neither this types of situation may increase the dissatisfaction among the guests. Hope you understand.",2
605,"The breakfast is good as well as the  bed which is very comfortable . The only black point is the Bath room , always leakage of water and this can drain down the positive side of the hotel",3
606,"the Bathroom as said above , the only pain point . 2nd time I am experiencing same",3
607,"Perfect location in Colombo, with easy access to transport, restaurants, and shops. Super comfy rooms, great wi-fi, and an abundance of in-house restaurants and bars.",5
608,Average check in experience. Room service takes a while.,4
609,"We have stayed at the hotel at least once a year for more than a decade. At this point, especially considering the abundance of newer hotels from which to choose, CG feels tired and the service spotty at best. Housekeeping was particularly spotty with one excellent maid and others who were definitely not on point. We stayed 3 weeks so we had plenty of time to judge. If not for proximity to family, we would have stayed elsewhere.",3
610,"Staff were rude and snobbish, during check in the card I had used to reserve the room was declined so we used a different one to make payment. After being shown our room an attendant was sent in to remove everything inside the mini bar. We stood and watched on as he placed everything in to a plastic bag, whilst explaining that the reception staff had told him to do so. It was extremely uncomfortable for both parties and we had literally been in the room for only a couple of minutes. The room was tired and shabby, with flaking paint and plug sockets which didn't work. We were glad to leave in the morning and would not recommend, definitely not what we would have expected from a 5 star hotel. Disgusting and rude behaviour from the staff who did not make us feel welcome.",2
611,The hotel  is well situated  and provides different types af transport within  easy reach. The breafast has wide range of foodstuffs Moreover the front line staff  is very friendly and efficient. A small shopping mall is attached to the hotel with a food court whereby gusts may stroll .,4
612,"The staff was friendly and very helpful at all times. The hotel can accomodate  several events at a time like wedding  reception  , conference etc....  This contributes to the hotel""s lively atmosphere. The cafe is s  good place to entertain friends with live music as background.  However the rooms appear old  and furniture requires an uplift. Overall  a very good hotel with minor issues for improvement. I would  strongly recommend this hotel for stay.",4
613,Staff were friendly and helpful. Clean property. Easy location. Liked dining areas specially for vegetarian guests. Nice lobby with good music and very attentive staff. Certainly will recommend to friends and family,5
614,For a triple room they provided a folding bed for the third person. Poor lighting in corridors. Noisy during functions. Airport transfer was pricy from the travel desk. We opted for private transfers which was considerably less expensive.,3
615,I like the staff who served the breakfast. They are so friendly and the food is nice.,4
616,"The sound approved was so poor. The last night stayed in Cinnamon Grand hotel, I totally cannot sleep because it was so noisy from the next door. Can hear everything, flash toilet, talking, door closing, walking sound... Staff knocked my door few times at 9.30pm asking for housekeeping. Not sure, is that a normal practice in Sri Lanka hotel? The room is much under my expectation with the money I paid. Not worth it at all!",2
617,Quality hotel with good facilities. Central and resort like features with a large number of restaurants all reasonably priced.,4
618,Check out could be quicker. Plenty of computer terminals but not enough staff attending to those leaving in the morning peak.,4
619,"Efficient, comfortable, large hotel. Spotless room, great shower. Attractive pools. Excellent buffet breakfast choice. Staff friendly and attentive. Large range of restaurant choices.",5
620,I would prefer to have my own teapot at breakfast. The waiting staff were so busy it took forever to get a top up.,3
621,"Breakfast not up to par with a continental breakfast.  Food is of poor quality.  Also had dinner at Chutneys and the food is very average.  If you wish to cater to tourists, please upgrade the quality of your food.",3
622,"checking out from there.. moved to kingsburry, just worth it.. cinnamon grand is good for its restaurants and not for the stay..",4
623,they do not know how to treat the guest's and the guest's request's.. very very poor PR.. so many more things to say instead would just like to say please do not stay there and also the bathrooms have no health faucets...very poor toileterie's...,1
624,Been there before many times and generally good experiences so keep going. The Indian restaurant Chutneys is my favourite. The Italian restaurant Echo was very good too.,5
625,Noise in the Lobby and the ceremonies and functions at base level of atrium made them very noisy due to high echo. Could be disturbing at lower floors. Maybe try a different one next time for some more quite,5
626,The place is centrally located.The breakfast is a feast.The guys in the kitchen and dining are awesome,5
627,The check in process was too slow.Too many hidden charges with BnB,2
628,Everything was good and excellent about this hotel. No second thoughts of me traveling to the place again with or without family. But only one thing I had issue with Booking.com since it was a non refundable booking when I preponed my date of return the hotel said it might be difficult but they did give the benefit of reality and accepted the preponement without any financial damage.,5
629,Nothing about the hotel,4
630,I liked nothing,4
631,"It was the worst experience of my life, in the middle of the night a Chinese couple enters to my room,while I was fast asleep and ask me to move out from my room. Couple had the room key where same room no. was mentioned. So, basically there staff is so negligent or there booking system's still survives on hand written register. Where they could not figure out that they have given me this room in afternoon and they are allotting the same room to couple. Very unprofessional staff did not even came to apologize about the incident, until and unless I did not went down for check out. My suggestion would be not to stay in this hotel, even if it is for free, you never know who will barge inn in your room in the middle of the night. PATHETIC.",2
632,"Excellent staff, great facilities with a wide choice of restaurants all serving excellent food at reasonable prices",5
633,"The standard room is a little small, Iâd recommend Deluxe and above",4
634,"Comfortable room,breakfast very good and good restaurants on site.The location is very good.  The staff were very helpful and attentive and very efficient",5
635,The reception on the TV was not good,4
636,"Location was superb and service too from the moment of check-in to checkout at 5 am in the morning was unparalleled. Few hotels could probably match it. Efficiency and kindness of each staff member one encountered - and such a huge hotel (14 restaurants) necessitates an enormous body of staff - was exemplary and spontaneous. The Chinese restaurant Tao was so good we spent both evenings. Lovely ambience, service and cuisine.",5
637,Nothing.,5
638,Staff are friendly and courteous which then delivers a great atmosphere and with the hotel close to all shopping centres and attractions itâs the right and best place to stay.,5
639,"Every time we visit Sri Lanka we stay here. A huge variety of eating places. Excellent staff, especially Sanjay at the front desk.",5
640,Coffee shop a bit chaotic,4
641,"The bed is good, the staff are very friendly, helpful & hospitality.Room has everything people need, Family Hotel. has joined market.They have guest house for stay those who's catch night flight.",5
642,"The extra bed was like stone, TV wasn't clear, only one restaurant open 24 hour, less Taxi next to the hotel, as the hotel car is very expensive",2
643,"Chamlia and the executive lounge team we're fantastic. As we're my floor butlers, basically all staff were exemplary, professionals. The best service I've ever received of any hotel I've had the pleasure of staying at.",5
644,Everything was perfect,5
645,"1. Amazing customer service and wonderful staff.
2. Clean place, positive energy everywhere, happy people and peaceful environment.
3. The food is unbelievable and heavenly delicious and can't describe the wonderful taste.
4. They are amazing.",5
646,Comfy room and very tastefully decorated.,5
647,Unfriendly staff and the lack of a warm inviting welcome... the check in process was the worst i have encountered...,1
648,Excellent management they listened to our complaint very profesionaly and even waved some F&B charges,5
649,The food and beverage service at the restaurant was very slow as was room service and the staff kept telling is food is read but still took half an hour to arrive,3
650,Centrally situated in Colombo with easy access to most facilities including an adjoining shopping mall.,4
651,My first visit to the Cinnamon Grand and I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience there,5
652,Accommodated our request after the initial mishap ,4
653,"Initial roomâs toilet was flooding 
We were then given another room which could not accommodate 3 beds
When we complained we were given s very good room how ever the additional bed was not comfortable ",4
654,"We have been at the Cinnamon many times as we feel like at home. The staff members are very kind and respectful, the room was clean and the hotel has many great restaurants and is at the heart of Colombo.",4
655,"As we stayed on the 9th floor, there was some noise probably coming from works been done on the flat roof.",4
656,"Very nice hotel, spacious, very clean. staff helpful and friendly. Great location close to every thing. Non smoking and quiet.",5
657,Bed to soft for us and non fitted sheet.,5
658,"We stayed here for one night as it was only a short 45 minute drive from the airport into Colombo and we needed somewhere post flight to recharge batteries ahead of a 2 week holiday.It's a beautiful hotel - with some amazing restaurants and a great pool. Thoroughly enjoyable stay.",4
659,"We were only there for 1 night - so nothing to grumble about really. It hammered it down with rain for an hour in the evening - but hardly the hotel's fault! The staff did constantly push tripadvisor cards our way with their names on - but again without positive reviews they don't get noticed, so it's understandable.",5
660,everything was in the room perfectly arranged. Mr. Wiganeshwar who served us the room service beyond the expectations.. he was kind enough to take care of every need. humble knowledgeable staff member ever.,5
661,nan,5
662,"Good food and average room..Old rooms..Room service is good. Serves in 30min exactly.House keeping is good.. any requests made, helped us on time..Good staff from Travel.. but expensive ..",3
663,"Hotel staff... Not sure, what their job is .. I wish your camera reviews /monitors their job atleast now and pays attention to customersHotel lobby ...Itâs completely a business hotel and not for people who visit for a vacation or leisure purpose.Reception area or lobby is always occupied with crowd(donât know who they are).. you canât sit and relax in the lobby.. They might want you to be in the room or visit the mall all time..(not to relax anywhere else)Hotel restaurent staffs..You get complementary breakfast.. But no attention from staffs.. there is some exception, who still believe in their hardwork( few women staff were amazingly hardworking during such peak morning time )You have choice of food from 14 different places within Cinnamon grand.Food is good..But....Every restaurant staff.. wants you to give feedback about them.. So they give you a long name list and request you to put it on TripAdvisor before 12AM :) .. Whoever reads this, correct me, if Iâm wrong..Checkin:Checkin was Smooth.. But people in the reception can have some some smile on their face.. Can Your camera monitor this?? This might help you to increase some ratings.. without any additonal efforts..",5
664,"The room is quite old. The carpet smells. The service in the coffee shop was bad. Very slow. I need to follow up my order twice & i need to go to the counter to get my bill. Poor service. The lagoon restaurant is highly recommended. Staff & service was fantastic.",2
665,"Am a frequent stayer at this property. And they dined to to have a early check in of 2 hour in advance. No privilege, No courtesy, ...... They should at least consider who had stayed with more times. I requested them am checking out early too. They won't care at all saying it's hotel policy. But as a frequent guest,,,,,,",1
666,"i like the facilities, i've requested a good and nice view of room and did gave it . i tried the dinner buffet and i love it . the breakfast makes my day start energetic . the staff are very nice .good bar to cheers. so relaxing and comfortable and securable . i'll be back soon .",5
667,nothing but i was expected that i can have a bay view room .. but its fine .,4
668,The beds were comfy and the room overall clean,4
669,When in the pool area the extractor chimney coming from the kitchen ( I assume) emitted black toxic smoke for approximately 3 minutes and left a foul smell and smoke over the pool,2
670,Staff / location of hotel,4
671,"No door bell, could not hear people knocking when I was in the bedroom. Why doesnât a 5* hotel have a bell. Missed room service and guests thought I was ignoring them. I donât think other people should be allowed to sign on my bill when Iâm not in the room. It was a ladyâs room but they were letting men sign for meals, cigarettes and drinks when I was not there or sleeping. It should be only the owner (person paying) who is allowed to sign for products on my bill? I canât help it if my acquaintances  and their friends are cheap. In Dubai a man would never disrespect himself by letting a woman pay for him. I am not used to that and was surprised by the large room service bill I was handed at the end.",1
672,Good location.,3
673,"Cinnamon Grand was a disappointment. Some of the phones in our suite were not working, some of the light bulbs had blown and the tube light in the walk-in wardrobe was flickering. Moreover, we had to wait on the line for ages for reception and housekeeping to answer the phone. Obviously our suite had been unused for a long time. It would have been better for a staff member to occupy the suite to identify all the issues before letting it out to guests.There was also no privacy in the hotel. My wife and I felt that we were being watched every moment. When I went out for dinner and walked into the hotel, a staff member asks me, âCan I help you?â In a rather curt manner. Very unpleasant indeed.",5
674,"I have booked this property for my colleque , this is a gift for him.But ,property have charged from him , even though I sent a mail request not to charge from him, charge from my  card.  DISAPPOINTED",2
675,"The staff are what makes this place truly Grand. Every person I spoke with was very attentive, energetic and helpful. The number of restaurants is dazzling, and the rooms/facilities are impeccable. Pricey, but worth the money!",5
676,"The location is excellent, and the food has always been consistently good for many years. Favourite restaurant was Taos, disappointed that it is changed to a Chinese restaurant.",4
677,Changing Tao to a Chinese restaurant.,5
678,"Since my mother and i had a really early flight unfortunately we did not have a chance to enjoy the breakfast at the hotel. Instead our receptionist Teshan was so kind to prepare a lovely to-go breakfast box that was ready when we checked out, we enjoyed it on the way to the airport. It is right next to a mall which we also enjoyed and a great coffee bar with lots of tasty cakes that we brought up to our room after dinner. Wish we had longer time to stay at this lovely hotel.",4
679,"Room was extremely comfortable, staff were very courteous and friendly and all facilities available if required. Probably what made my stay even better was the staff themselves. I did not want for anything, and even though I was travelling alone, and this was my first visit tho the Grand, I felt as if I had been before.",4
680,Food in the accosicated restaurants were very tasty and of high quality.,5
681,"The personnel seemed a bit disorganised, both in the hotel and in the associated restaurants we tried.
We expected a higher comfort for this price.",3
682,"Useful small shopping mall beside the hotelGreat staffsGood house keeping serviceGood cafe shope",4
683,"Very old furnitures General design of corridors was so old.A lot of business men around.",3
684,"Tennis court was a pleasant surprise but it needs to be better maintained. I liked the service and friendly staff too and Coffee Stop was the best for its coffee, pastries and macaroons!",4
685,Tennis court wasnât well maintained. The fences had holes in them and balls kept flying out through the holes.,2
686,The lobby area is buzzing with energy all the time. Loved the music that was being played most of the time and your seafood restaurant gets full marks. the most amazing sea food that I have ever had. Also breakfast was excellent.,5
687,The rooms are really dated. They don't have the modern look that most 5 stars have nowadays. Need to improve the rooms.,3
688,"Very good choice of restaurantsFriendly staffLocation",4
689,"Organised taxi service extremely expensive versus private or localEg airport $52 via hotel, $30 elsewhere.",2
690,"Food at Lagoon was good, I appreciate and enjoyed the complementary coconut snack.",5
691,"I could hear sounds/voices of other customers in corridor from inside my room and sometimes they were rather loud. The Chinese food at Tao restaurant was just average. We ordered steam fish but the meat consistency was a bit lacking.",3
692,I had previously broken my foot and all staff were extremely helpful,4
693,Extra tax payments were not notified on booking.com website and we paid 30% which is more than most hotels. Hotel and booking.com bed to be clearerâs as our receipt notification said total price and this was incorrect,4
694,It was well lit and comfortable.,4
695,The room which was given to me earlier. I refused to take it. A female traveling with her little daughter should not be given adjoining rooms.,3
696,"I like the new room they give it to me ,,, I like the restaurant in this hotel",5
697,"The first old room they give it to meThe kangaroo taxi was problem not come on time when they call them",4
698,"It says on the booking site that shuttle bus to the airport is available which is wrong.  There is no shuttle bus, you can get a hotel taxi for USD46, while the meter taxi will cost half the price.",3
699,Great value for a 5* suite for us and our toddler. Fantastic facilities and choice of restaurants.,5
700,"Original suite was by an elevator shaft so very noisy ALL night, but they moved us the following day and upgraded us",3
701,"Easy access to everything. The shopping mall next to the hotel, makes your life easy.",5
702,The rooms arenât soundproof. Some Tamil musical show was held next to the hotel the day we went. It was loud and we couldnât sleep till midnight. ,2
703,Clean with lots of restaurants and facilities. ,4
704,"Given check in time was 1, I tried to check in at 4 and the room was still not ready for 40 mins. On the upside they upgraded me to a suite.
Some parts of the hotel are looking dated, like the front desk, if you look up,  there are cracks all over near the vents, the paint is a different shade between the old and new wing, hardly issues, but hardly 5 star standard. ",3
705,The room was extremely comfortable as was the bed. It was in fact very difficult to get out of bed in the morning although it was helped by the delivery of a great breakfast. In room dining is so much nicer and food was delivered on time every time.,5
706,I have stayed in this hotel twice in the last few weeks and each time on check in the front desk staff tried to debit more from my credit card than they said they would. Coincidence?  Matbe but always worth checking the sum to be debited.,2
707,"The facilities, restaurants and pool in this first class hotel were excellent.",5
708,The rooms were very small and I would have expected better for the price we paid.,3
709,"Food here is amazing especially the breakfast Beds are very comfy",5
710,Check in could be a lot quicker. It seemed very slow. Also the keys didnât work to get into one of the rooms. Which was a bit annoying after a long flight .,3
711,everything except what I'm going to write below,5
712,"after we put the do not disturb sign, the reception starts to call to ask when are we going to clean the room, after that housekeeping calls for same . so much disturbance! even after we showed tat we didn't like these calls, the hotel kept on doing this everyday, many times, it made me really pissed off. the only reason why we stay in was to get some sleep and we see no point if hotel people call us many times. very disappointed.last time also it was same. no improvement.",3
713,"Excellent staff Very helpful Nice restaurants",5
714,"The swimming pool has a sheesha area so you are passive smoking while swimming .Irritated to see that most who are using sheesha are non swimmers just ogling at girls in the pool!!",2
715,"LAGOON RESTAURANT IS GREAT AND MAKE OUR NIGHT PERFECTSTAFF IN LAGOON THE MANAGER AND OTHER TEAM ARE GREATCHEF COOK IN LAGOON IS A SPECIALIST SEAFOODI WILL COME BACK ONE DAY",5
716,"I HAD A BIT PROBLEM WITH CHECK IN WE ARRIVED 5:30AM THEREFORE WE WAS GIVEN GUEST REST ROOM TO WAIT TILL 9AMI GET INTO THE ROOM AROUND 10 AM ++ THAT WAS NOT PLEASANT WELCOMELONG DAY FOR US AFTER A LONG FLIGHT PLEASE CREATE AN EASY CHECK IN",4
717,"Great location , shopping mall and food court next to hotel. Lovely staff , especially the young trainee  receptionist who was so helpful and enthusiastic about his job. Special mention to Merril at Breeze bar who was wonderful. Have stayed here a few times now and am never disappointed. I think itâs the best hotel in Colombo!",4
718,Canât think of anything!,3
719,"Loved the facilities in terms of the pool, well equipped gym, access to shops and the general relaxed charming atmosphere in the lobby etc.",5
720,"As a regular visitor I keep going back to the Cinnamon Grand mainly because of it's facilities in terms of restaurants and it's location. But every time at check in time, which is generally at 1 am in the morning we go to the room to find the Triple Room booking is not quite as we expected.The room is not ready for occupation. This is after we had communicated with hotel prior to arrival, about the bed configuration. This would avoid the hassle of having to get an UNSUITABLE fold up bed brought in at that late hour when all we want to do at that time is to go to bed after having spent a whole day travelling.Plus there were only two towels, cups, etc etc for 3 adults. My advise to the hotel would be to inform prospective guests at the time of booking that the hotel does NOT have TRIPLE ACCOMMODATION. This is one area that seriously needs improvement.",3
721,"Breakfast was fantastic ,lunch and dinner had a choice  of  fifteen restaurants,Nuga gama sri lanka village style dinner under the trees. Chutneys south indian  food.Transfer from airport to hotel was good driver was waiting for us.criscat mall was just next door to hotel entrance open till late.",4
722,Very comfortable and clean rooms,4
723,"It's more like a Vegas casino lobby when you come out of the lifts, there are always people (non hotel customers) around due to the many restaurants. Always having to make your way around them to get in or out. Unfortunately as I was heading out for excursions each day and would come back dishevelled, the staff would attempt to restrict me from entering but hold doors open for visitors. I couldn't get a table for dinner with friends as the restaurants were always fully booked.",3
724,The grounds were really nice and had a grand atmosphere,5
725,"The absolute rip off of 40% in taxes and service charges is disgusting and dishonest, it once again shows how Sri Lanka completely takes advantage of tourists",1
726,"Great hotel. excellent service, everything you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. There are about 14 restaurant in the hotel. various varieties to choose from. And they serve great dishes as well. Wish I had more time to try all the restaurant.",5
727,The hotel was kind of busy on the outside. Cars come in and goes out non-stop. I wish they had a special place for disabled passengers. It can be a bit dodgy trying to park the car closest to the entrance when you have crazy traffic at your door step.,4
728,The bed abs pillows were really comfy. The food was amazing and the atmosphere festive.,5
729,"Some of the rooms are a little out of date: however, the hotel is in the process of renovating",3
730,"Very courteous. No fuss on any request. Extremely clean rooms and bathrooms. 
It's a happening hotel where you cannot get bored . Saw some srilankan weddings , interesting.
There are plenty of restaurants with amazing food.
",5
731,Nothing that I can point out that I did not like about the property.,4
732,Very comfy bed.  Nice if you like very large hotels. Food in the Lagoon restaurant was good.,5
733,"There were bird droppings around the pool, one even landed on my husbands plate at lunch.",2
734,The bed and the pillows were comfy. The hotel lobby is the best one can find in colombo. Express check out was efficient.,4
735,"The check in process was a bit cumbersome and it took quite a while (more than 25 minutes) as we had to make several calls for the formalities to be completed,before we got wifi and our passports back.",3
736,"Nice clean and comfortable rooms, good service from friendly staff, good shower pressure and water temperature, lots of reasonably priced restaurants and room service (the burgers are great!)",4
737,"The hotel is a bit dated. There was a power cut in our room which took 45 mins to come and resolve (instantly fixed when they arrived so have a feeling itâs a common problem) - it made us late for a wedding we had traveled to Sri Lanka for so that was disappointing, but they did bring us some nice fruits and sweets to apologise after we complained.",3
738,"One of the best hotels Iâve had the pleasure of living in. Staff was super and when I informed them that my wife and I were on our 12th anniversary they sent a cake a and a bottle of wine to the room. The gym was top notch and the restaurants were brilliant. The location canât be beat and the hotel taxis were available 24/7. The best hotel in Colombo, bar none!",5
739,I suppose if really pushing it the only slight criticism was that the hotel taxis were very pricey considering than trickshaws were about 10 percent of the same price on the same distance.,4
740,"The customer service was excellent from start to finish.The children were welcomed with sweets and juice which they loved and the reception staff engaged with the children making them feel welcomed and important guests also.The view from the room was excellent as was room service.",5
741,We ordered a car prior to arrival to collect us from the airport but the car didnât arrive. It was resolved at the airport quickly but this was disappointing.,3
742,Staff service was excellent !,5
743,"Initial room smelt Smokey so we needed to Change our room but that was done easily and quickly. Staff were very obliging to our request",4
744,Great service and excellent room service breakfast. Good value for money overall. ,5
745,Shower door did not close properly.  Take care when stepping in and out. ,2
746,"Location, eating options, the vibrant vibe, a shopping mall next door.",4
747,Can get too crowded in season. Reserve your table at restaurants as even in-house guests can be kept waiting. The restaurants are popular with locals.,5
748,"The room is quite comfortable and sufficient place for children to play""hide & See"".",4
749,"Buffet manager & waiters are quite lacking flexibility & adjustment, we went on Jan 1st at 8:20 PM, still half vacancy are there, but they rejected us and said that is already booking, so sad, there is no adjustment at all, quite a disappoint. I believed, someone may have booked but not attend it at that night, it is better they can reconfirm it before they rejected customers.",1
750,The Premium Room on the first part of our stay!,2
751,"Deluxe Room was not as good as the Premium Room therefore slightly disappointed. It is of an old style, in a different wing!",3
752,Location was good. ,4
753,Old property. Interiors are uninspiring. You will be asked to pay on the spot cash for every room service even at 11pm if your room is booked under a basic package. Service staff also felt like not trained well enough. It was difficult for us to communicate with our room service steward. Front desk also too curt. ,2
754,The ambiance was amazing. Topped that with the best homemade cookies and ice coffee. The staff were all amazing and we were yet to find something they couldn't or wouldn't be able to help with.,5
755,More HD TV channel with movies and entertainment.,5
756,Location is spot on and the restaurants are great,4
757,"Rooms needs updating. I donât know whether it was 9th floor rooms but we could hear lifts every minute and we were literally at the other end of the corridor 
",3
758,Very comfortable bed with lots of restaurants to pick from for dinner. Lobby was amazing and very beautiful. Lots to do inside the hotel which was good. Staff very friendly and attentive. ,4
759,Pool was pretty average for a 5 star hotel. Location not that good if you want to explore Colombo. ,3
760,"Everything was perfect. My wife is wheelchair bound. Our 2 kids are both 10yrs old. During booking, I requested for an accessible room plus connecting to another room (for the kids). I got exactly what I requested. The staff went out of their way to make our stay a memorable one. Good job to the staff and management of the hotel.",5
761,"As it was a huge hotel and a famous one at that, the drop off area seems to be a wee bit too busy to our liking. To get the perfect spot to drop off (due to my disabled wife) can be challenging sometimes.",4
762,breakfast was brilliant..staff was excellent...everyone eager to make our stay comfortable,4
763,I was disappointed with the room assignment. They gave us a room on the older side and the property was fairly run down...the view was poor from the room...the gloomy look on the older side of the property wasn't nice...,2
764,They have put a lot of space to the entrance of the room rather than taking care of the washroom. The washroom did not have enough space and quite hard to use as well. Did not include a good view for the room. As a five star hotel we expected more from Cinnamon Grand.,3
765,"What an amazing property.Our check-in was super smooth, very warm and welcoming staff. Sanjay in particular was amazing, he made sure we got the best room with good views, and went out of his way to get us checked-in and comfortable. They have some amazing little touches which ensures you can have the relaxing vacation you are after. The pool side area was my favourite - with bean bags, hammocks, food, drinks and Sheesha and the most lovely staff at the sheesha counter. It is really green with trees all around, and works as your own little haven away from the chaos of the city. Imagine, taking a quick swim in the pool after a day of sight-seeing and then relaxing with a glass of wine and sheesha or just laying in the hammock and watching the stars. The rooms are well sized, very clean and comfortable with views of the pool or city. I had two meals at their restaurant, Chutney, and both were delicious. We also had a couple drinks at their pool side bar, with live music. I recommend staying at this property. I will definitely come back when in Colombo next.Also shared on TripAdvisor: https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g293962-d597086-r542177841-Cinnamon_Grand_Colombo-Colombo_Western_Province.html#",4
766,"It was perfect, so nothing to not like.",5
767,"Tania at the reception was very good and helpful.She understand the guest better. Some guys at the front desk was ?Room service was good and overall good place to stay.",4
768,I liked the choice of pillows and the bed was nice and comfy.  The Lagoon restaurant is still one of my favourite restaurants in the world but we think the fish wasn't very fresh as we both got upset tummies after.,4
769,"They were under renovations at the time yet the prices were the same as high season yet all the beautiful things in the lobby were covered up and workmen were all over the place. The rooms themselves are very average, bathroom also just OK. I wanted more as the lobby is usually spectacular but the rooms were just average. The pizza from the Ecco restaurant was small and tasteless with no tomato sauce? We ordered it with fresh chilli and mushrooms yet there was no chilli taste.",3
770,"Very central location, very friendly + helpful staff, awesome airport shuttle with new Audi Q3, driver Mr. Andrew was funny + charming guy.",5
771,"For this price I expect new + clean room, reception could only give me one of the old rooms, theyare not worth the money! Small, not clean.Next time I expect new room in the new building / wing located directly in the back of reception desk!",3
772,the service of the staff is excellent ... the breakfast    very very good ......all very good at this hotel   and we were in lot of hotel in the world .... cinnamon grand hotel is the best,5
773,nothing       all good,4
774,Everything. So many amazing restaurants. I have coeliac disease and they catered really well to my requirements. Nice to have a cocktail by the pool.,4
775,Only negative was that staff by the pool were friendly but inattentive - we had to ask for the menu and even after that had to approach them to get service. There were plenty of staff around so that wasnât the issue. ,4
776,It is a large hotel with many facilities. it has a decent sized Mall attached to it which makes it convenient for any last minute shopping. the location is good and allows you to reach most places in reasonable time. The staff were always smiling and nice.,4
777,The room was a little tired and could do with some upgrades. there was a lot of noise coming in from the renovation/painting/structural work going on in the main lobby. In general the room service is slow.,3
778,Sea food restaurant had amazing range and was reasonably priced. Breakfast menu had lots of varieties.,4
779,"Washrooms: They are bit dated , property doenst have single lever mechanism to mix hot and cold water , also jet spray is missing with WC. I think jet spary is  an absolute must for personal hygiene and really needed for Muslim travelers.",2
780,Customer service and staff responsiveness is exceptional!,4
781,"Hotel under renovation and compared to newer better hotels, price is too high. Also low occupancy so lot of staff just walking around and food seems stale and old probably due to low occupancy turn over rate",3
782,"The Hotel staffs were very kind and very freindly, especially the Concirge, Mr. Samantha, Mr. Sajeewa, and the Casher, Mr. Eranga.  They were very kind and gave me a very usefull informations not to drop into the various troubles.  Particurary Mr. Samantha is a very kind person who helped me, even if after my check-out  from the Hotel, because I lost my personal thing by my quite fault.  Really thank you for his help, so I want to stay again and want to meet with him.",5
783,"1, bed-size;    I felt the bed's length size is a little short, as even if my tall is 175cm around. And the bed's width size is OK.2, room sandal;    There is no sandals in almost excellent hotels in Sri Lanka, these inferiority matter were written in my article, the Lanka-Deepa news-paper 22/Nov/2015.",5
784,Staff at the breakfast was very attentive and even remembered order of the previous day. Breakfast selection was very good!,5
785,Healthy food options were limited.,3
786,Ambience,5
787,"Except for The Lagoon, the service in all the other places was very ordinary. WiFi was useless. Response to any queries or help required was very poor.",2
788,I like the hotel services and staff. Food were very good and so tasty.,5
789,"I have noticed that, there is no Hand Spray in the toilet. As an European style that is ok but I have seen many of Asian people were stayed at hotel and I'm sure they might be had little bit embarrassed about that and also will be lead to the matter of cleanness of wash room.",3
790,"The breakfast is outstanding! But some of the services are not up to 5 stars, for example, I needed an adapter I had to call 4 times until I finally got it, no fruit in the rooms and the bathroom is rather old. But I heard they do a renovation in the hotel in the other wing, however, there was no noise which disturbed me. But overall the stay was ok.",3
791,We have stayed at the Cinnamon Grand many times and have always been happy with our stay.  The Location is excellent and Convenient for restaurants and shopping and the staff are very pleasant and helpful.  The hotel has a beautiful ambience and spacious surroundings....,5
792,"the location, and the fine dining restaurants keeps this property alive.",5
793,"we paid 900$ for 6 nights , and the rooms, are old, and they need renovation, and they gave us the old part of the hotel, which was not fair, for the price we paid, so it was definately not value for money .",2
794,"Hotel was excellent. Swimming pool area superb. Service was exceptional particularly at breakfast, so friendly! Choice of hotel restaurants was amazing but a special mention for TAO restaurant where the food was stunning and service exceptional. Will definitely return.",5
795,Nothing!!,5
796,"First I want give 5 from 5 ***** to Mrss LEEZA for all great job she doing for guest of hotel    Thank you too much
All of hotel is very good 
",4
797,Special food as you like and as you want I found this first time but not last very friendly staff very clean and calm hotel ,5
798,"Second stay here, the hotel for me is the best in the city of Colombo in terms of quality.Price is a bit steep considering your other choices however facility's in the hotel are like no other.",4
799,"Wrong room, the room details in booking is completely wrong.The size of the rooms are wrong and never updated, pictures are wrong.I booked a suite room, the pictured showed that this room is on the vip floor with access to seperate breakfast areas.In reality the room was in a different tower of the hotel, and was an apartment.I asked the hotel checkin staff Taniya to change the rooms and advise cost difference, never got a reply during my stay.",3
800,"Staff were very nice, friendly and helpful. I would like to single out Ms Melanie and Mr Brian of Front Office and Mr Nimal ( main restaurant that serves breakfast) They went that extra mile to ensure our stay was comfortable.Thank you.",5
801,"Connecting rooms is not a good option if the occupants are not family.Walls between rooms are of poor sound proof quality.Occupants in the other room were noisy so nights were sometimes disturbed and not peaceful .",3
802,The staff was very friendly and the bed was comfortable.,4
803,"The hotel is old and that's noticeable in the rooms, decors and piping.  Also it's really business focused, I would not recommend for holiday.",2
804,"Breakfast was very busy but there was a good variety and service. There are many restaurants at the hotel, all very good, especially the Lagoon, the fish restaurant. We had a lovely room.",4
805,"This is our second stay at the hotel, and it is as good as the first time!",5
806,Breakfast was a highlight in this property and the location its situated. ,4
807,The AC of the property is very old and it takes ages to cool. Also its really slow and doesnt cool the room entirely.,2
808,"The food at the Lagoon restaurant was superb and so was their service. Pricey but was well worth it because the food was delicious.   The breakfast spread was very good and lots of varieties.",5
809,The rooms were a little dated and needed some refurbishment.,3
810,we are satisfied what was on offer and the staffs are very friendly and delivered all services as we requested without any delays and also they have extended our checkout time late for free as well.,5
811,we had a two single folding beds for our kids and they are not that comfy.,4
812,"Staff at the property were excellent, especially Leeza in the lobby. Her welcoming smile and genuine interest in how we were was warming and really enhanced our visit. She is. a true asset! They really could not have done more for us and everything was done with a smile. The bed in the suite was very comfortable. Room service was excellent, everything was cleaned and tidied immaculately. Staff regularly asked if we had everything we needed in the rooms, even after completing a full room service. This hotel alone is reason enough to return to Sri Lanka.",5
813,"Given the size and prestige of this hotel, I do think that a children's club would be a useful addition. The area in Cheers is small, organised activities with a timetable would be great. Rooftop pool a little tired looking and was too deep for my nine year old (although there is an excellent pool outside though not as private as right next to bar area). However these are minor points and in no way affected our overall stay which can only be described as excellent).",3
814,Heaps of fruits in the restaurant and good authentic food,4
815,The reception asked for passport or identification to register which I did not have; nor they informed me to bring one.  They were not very good and kept on arguing and finally I had to use my I phone on international roaming to pull out some e-mails.  Not friendly at all. They should have asked me to send a copy of passport via e-mail if they really need it. I stayed in a different hotel  two day ago in Anuradhapura without any harassment,2
816,Upon checkout Chamila in reception desk was so polite and act very professional,3
817,"Cleanliness was terrible, hair found in bed, sofa and every where. Dusting was not fine for months. Carpet with heavy stain which we can't walk without slippers. Found some pillows with heavy stain which they change after complaining. Bathroom was very un hygiene. Bathtub full of soap scums... very very dirty.... printing menus with lipstick marks and previous guest finger marks and food stains. Very unhygienic and dirty environments. It was a waste of money. Only named as five star but it was like 2 star hotel. I will never ever stay with Cinnamon Grand again.",1
818,"Dear all, all of staffs in the cinnamon grand are not friendly and not cooperative to the customer, we are the customer whether we are poor or rich the should be equal whether they coming any country of the worlds or if are black or white customer you all have to equal service. This was my first time in the cinnamon grand but Iâve been cinnamon red 2 times.Iâm also working in the duty free and Iâm senor supervisor sales so we are doing same thing and approach human being there want be any diffentsate to any customer to your shettur like 5 stars.I hope that wouldnât happen in any country of this worlds. Thanks",5
819,I will give full point those staying in the entrance door of the cinnamon grand and would like to say they are staffs they are doing good job cause any customer coming going through the entrance they will great in and out. Iâm very much thanks for those staffs.,4
820,The hotel is a good place to stay. I wouldn't say excellent.,4
821,"The forgetfullness of room service about our meal orders. It's something to watch out for if you order room service and then patiently wait ! Remind them in about 15 minutes,not 45 mins like I did!",4
822,best breakfast ever. the staff is wonderful.,5
823,"the wifi is so bad. didnt knew i would find so bad wifi in 2017. wifi was even bad in the lobby. jus all around the facility.and then one odd thing. they were putting up camera at the pool, is that legal?and then im pretty sure i was bitten by bedbugs.they did not change mattress, just the sheet",2
824,"room 854 room was good in size but  room needed restoration . they were willing to shift me to the new wing but i did not . bathrooms in old wing were very bad . tiles and fixtures were old. overall polish was required. food was super so was the service. breakfast had large spread.",4
825,bathroom,4
826,"Great location. good breakfast selection, restaurants, staffs were super service friendly.",5
827,nothing I can think of. But my room rates were overly priced I felt.,3
828,"Great lively lobby with a nice lobby menu and a cafe to order from. Foods good quality and nice service. Reception staff very good, helpful and friendly. The lobby is great if you want to meet friends and family for a chat. Rooms are nice and modern.  The hotel is in a great location.",5
829,"the quality of food at the breakfast buffet was poor and the service was very slow and no attention to detail. restaurant staff including managers didn't seem to care much.good variety of food but not everything was good quality.",4
830,"great location and good prices at the ""coffee stop."" Overall layout of the hotel is good.",4
831,"The service is absolutely abysmal at the restaurants (multiple) and the ""coffee stop."" People have no concept of time and are just utterly useless. The hotel looks a little dated but the rooms are quite nice themselves.",2
832,We liked everything but had lots of hiccups at the checking in.  Had to spend lots of time to get it cleared.  Rooms without breakfast is a bit of a hassle.,4
833,Ongoing System Failures,4
834,Atmosphere was very pleasant and generally we felt as we were athome,4
835,Booked for three adults and the third bed was like a camp bed my six foot tall daughter had a uncomfortable nights sleep . They couldn't find another single bed for her.,2
836,Staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel offers great restaurants of different cuisines and spa with massage. Nice live music in the evenings and lunch time at the lobby coffee shop. Very nice experience.,5
837,"Deluxe room was quite small, but comfy. Good breakfast, nice pool. Beautiful lobby. Friendly and smiling staff.",4
838,"No balcony. Window view - on a car parking.From early morning 8:30 till evening 21:00 pm every day was an annoying sound from the parking ( like car alarm or something). Really makes crazy.",4
839,Nuga Gama food was excellent and the manager and staffs at the restaurant were very friendly. Apart from that the room is average. The room that got was facing the back of the hotel. There was no view at all.,3
840,The room wasn't what I expected,4
841,Loved the pool cafe and bar. The staff was super helpful and made the most amazing sheesha.,5
842,The rooms are small and suitable for 2 people only. We were 3 people in a room and they put an extra bed so the room became cramped. If the hotel doesn't have bigger rooms for triple occupancy then they shouldn't offer it.,1
843,Guest Services Manager Hashan Dissanyake and the two FD associates who checked us in were especially helpful; cake for our anniversary was a very pleasant surprise. Thank you,5
844,"The Concierge information: on two occasions, I asked about a restaurant booking at a restaurant on the beach"" ""Lavinia Breeze""; in the morning I was informed that it was open until 10pm and no reservations needed as it was a weekday; just before leaving checked again and was told the restaurant was open until 10.30 pm and no resevations needed as it was a weekday; on the way to the restaurant at around 9pm, I entered the name in GPS for exaact location and directions for the driver only to find out that the restaurant was ""permanently closed""...",4
845,"Staff were very accommodating and a lovely ambience in the hotel facilities, restaurants and lobby. Food was of a very high standard in the restaurants near room service. Very nice decor",5
846,"The room was advertised for 3 adults however there was only a double bed provided with an undersized folding camp bed for the 3rd person. Though the double bed was comfortable, the 3rd bed was quite uncomfortable and not appropriate accomodation for an adult in a 5 star hotel. We were disappointed with the 3rd bed and felt a proper single bed should have been provided.",2
847,"We have been staying at the hotel every year for more than a decade for its convenient location. Our room was in the newly renovated wing of the hotel, so the bathroom was nice. The room was tastefully decorated too.",5
848,"Service, particularly in the hotel's many restaurants and room service, tends to be lackadaisical and not in keeping with international standards for a 5 star property. Was surprised that the hotel didn't revamp it's technology -- no USB ports or charging stations in the room - these are fairly standard today. We will probably try a different hotel next year.",3
849,"Wonderful breakfast. Staff around the pool area very helpful. Great location, central to the fort area.",5
850,Triple room setup was slow but got sorted in the end with the help of a senior member of staff.,5
851,"Breakfast is super, bed is amazingly comfy perfect nights sleep. staff super helpful",5
852,"I booked a queen size room but when I arrived I had 2 singles and was told the hotel was short of queen rooms. I asked to move which they did after I insisted, but made me wonder why they didn't Allocate the room I booked in the first place. Not a good start.",2
853,Its a typical 5 star hotel. Its got all the bells and whistles. We totally enjoyed this stay. Its got 5 restaurants on location so you are spoilt with choice. The breakfast buffet is fab!,4
854,Executive room and floor was a bonus - the lounge and all staff were fantastic. Highly recommended,5
855,Nothing - we treat with respect from start to finish,5
856,"The Staff is amazing ,from the Arrival to Departure,Bellboy immediately attend the luggage on arrival,Guest Relation officer Udari  well informed about the Arrival,Room  is Perfect,Preferred Sea View ,Sheanda arranged everything as requested.The room Directory is Well Planned and everything on Detailed.Sheanda and Udari are amazing ,Thanks a lot for everything,",5
857,"Waiting in  the Coffe Stop ,Space is not enough for the staff to move even .",5
858,Very poor customer service and the requested room was not given. Very bad attitude of staff specially the front desk girls and the hotel manager. Room had many issues and was not happy at all.,2
859,Location is excellent and the atmosphere is lively.,5
860,Had booked for a king sized bed and was given twin bed room. Also had requested for late check out with half day extra pay but the room key did not worked on the last day and hence had to travel back to reception for activating the room key again. This had been pointed out during check in but still the same happened again.,4
